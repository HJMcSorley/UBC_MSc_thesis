###   Study Site: Leech River Watershed

The Leech River watershed is a sub-catchment of the Sooke River watershed, the primary water supply for the Greater Victoria Area; the Leech River watershed is located west of Sooke Reservoir (Figure \@ref(fig:GVWSAoverview)). In anticipation of future water demands and uncertainty related to rainfall and climate change, the Capital Regional District (CRD) purchased about 92% of the Leech River watershed in 2007 (84%) and 2010 (additional 8%) and designated the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA) for future supplemental source water (~96 km^2^, elevation 215 to 870 m a.s.l). 

\

\  

Hydrology and water quality monitoring programs for the Leech began in 2017, thus there is little historical data to describe hydrochemical dynamics in the Leech watershed. The Leech River watershed includes three mainstem rivers (Cragg Creek, Leech River, and West Leech River) as well as several small headwater lakes (Weeks, Jarvis, and Worley) and wetlands (Jordan Meadows surrounding Weeks Lake and Lazar meadows north of Jarvis Lake). Runoff peaks in the winter under saturated conditions when rivers respond rapidly to precipitation events, rising and falling dramatically. Across the watershed, elevation ranges from approximately 200 m above sea level (asl), near the Leech Tunnel, to 941 m asl in the centre of the watershed, at the top of Survey Mountain. 


####    Climate, Weather, Forests

The Leech River watershed is in the Coastal Western Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone (CWH), with forests dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata); subspecies include white pine (Pinus monticola), amabalis fir (Abies amabilis), alder (Alnus rubra), broad-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) and arbutus (Arbutus menziesii). The watershed also includes the moist and dry maritime sub-zones of the CWH (Montane moist 43%, submontane moist 38%, xeric 19%) [@Ussery2015]. While some precipitation occurs as snow at higher elevations, the majority of the ~2000 mm per year is rain (i.e., pluvial hydroclimatic regime) [@ *refs*]. The water year can be broadly divided into wet and dry seasons where approximately 90% of precipitation falls from October to April, and May through September are relatively dry [@ *refs*]. 

\  

There are two weather stations (Table \@ref(tab:StnSummary)) which operated during the study period: Chris Creek station is located in the headwaters of the LWSA and Martin's Gulch station is located near the future diversion point (Leech River Tunnel). 

\  
 
```{r StnSummary}

         col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "*CRD fire weather station (FWx) summary of features*")

```

\

The CRD provided weather station data from Chris Creek and Martin's Gulch weather stations from January 2018 to March 2020. Rainfall and air temperature from each of the two LWSA weather stations is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:WxLWSA). Slightly more precipitation was recorded at Martin's Gulch than Chris Creek station. Annual weather data from each of the LWSA weather stations are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:WxLWSAdata).

```{r WxLWSA, out.width = "100%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:WxLWSA} *Weather from two stations in the Leech water supply area. Coloured sections of plots highlight the field study period of this project.*"

               digits = c(0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1))
``` 

\  

Using the R package _Rainmaker_ (USGS), rain data were used to define events that corresponded to sampling campaigns. Seasons were operationally defined based on periods with or without major rain events, where "wet" season included major events and "dry" season did not.


###   River sampling (FIX)

*fix this section*

River sampling was conducted from November 2018 to February 2020. *A total of 446 samples were collected from November 2018 to February 2020*, all samples were analyzed and some were excluded during quality control (more details please), resulting in 393 unique samples included in data analyses and results (Table \@ref(tab:samplecount)). Samples were collected and analyzed at UBC for DOC concentration and DOM character via high temperature combustion and UV-Vis spectroscopy (respectively). In addition, two sets of replicate samples from four sites were sent to forWater partners at the University of Waterloo for source water analyses of drinking water treatability metrics; and an additional 42 samples were collected on behalf of the CRD for analysis of a suite of total metals at an external laboratory (see Appendix). 

####    Synoptic sampling 

```{r sampleSitesMap, out.width = "75%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:sampleSitesMap} *Synoptic sampling sites across the Greater Victoria Water Supply Areas.*"

knitr::include_graphics("R-inputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/images/thesis_map_synoptic-sampling.png")
```

\  

Thirteen sites were selected for synoptic water sampling and water quality analyses, and their results were used to elucidate temporal patterns in DOM and DOC dynamics. Synoptic samples were collected bi-weekly to monthly from October 2018 to February 2020; a total of 206 unique synoptic samples were collected (229 including replicates). Figure \@ref(fig:sampleSitesMap) shows the locations of the synoptically sampled sites. Grab sampling at these sites involved collecting river samples in triple-rinsed acid-washed 250mL amber HDPE bottles. Samples were capped with minimal headspace and transported on in a cooler (on ice) to the lab for analysis.  

####    Sampling across nested catchments of the Leech watershed {#MethodsNestedCatch}

Six of the synoptic sampling sites were selected for more intensive monitoring. These sites represent the drainage area upstream of a future diversion at the Leech River Tunnel, and five sub-basins nested within the Leech Tunnel catchment 

Weeks Creek (site 1), had the greatest proportion of wetland and open water compared to the other sub-basins (Table \@ref(tab:WTScharacterSubbasinTable)). Chris Creek (site 2) and Cragg Creek (site 4) had no metasedimentary parent material (Argillite-Metagraywacke or Metagraywacke). Cragg Creek, draining from the east, was the only sub-basin with predominantly metamorphic parent material (Wark-Gneiss, 78%). West Leech (site 5) was the only sub-basin that did not have Wark-Gneiss nor Chert-Argillite-Volcanic groups as parent materials, and was the only sub-basin of the Metchosin igneous complex (16% Methchosin-volcanics). Like Weeks basin (site 1), which also drains from the West, WestLeech is predominantly underlain by Argillite-Metagreywacke (metasedimentary parent material).

###   Analytical techniques & data handling

Water samples were collected in acid-wached 250mL HDPE wide-mouth amber bottles and transported in coolers with ice to the lab for analysis of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and spectroscopic absorbance (indicator of NOM character).

Grab samples collected for DOC quantification were filtered and acidified within 36 hours of collection, except for a set of *12* late-season samples that were collected by CRD staff and refrigerated for two weeks prior to filtration & acidification. Hold-times for Rack samples were assessed and details are provided below (QA-QC section). Spectroscopy samples were not acidified. 

Samples were also measured for phosphate concentration using a colourmetric (ascorbic acid) orthophosphate test kit (HACH PO-19); each sample had phosphate concentration below detectable limits (0.1 mg/L). 

	
####    Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and characterization

For quantification of DOC, samples were analyzed for non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC) via High-Temperature Combustion (Method 5310-B) on a Shimadzu TOC-V [@StdMet2000]. For this method, samples were filtered with 0.45-micron PES filters, acidified to bring pH below 2, then sparged with hydrocarbon-free air to drive off inorganic carbon. Following sparging, samples were combusted to convert all organic carbon to carbon dioxide which was measured by non-dispersive infrared gas detector to quantify the DOC content of the sample. This method represents a direct measure of DOC; although small volatile organic compounds would be removed in the sparging process, most NOM compounds are of higher molecular weight and it is unlikely that NOM analytes would be lost [@StdMet2000; @Matilainen2011].

\  
 
Spectral properties of sample NOM were analyzed using a 'spectro::lyser' spectrophotometer (S::can, Vienna, Austria) which measures turbidity and the chromophoric portion of organic matter to estimate concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as well as nitrate-nitrogen (NO~3~^-^-N). For NOM to be detected by UV-Vis absorption, the molecules must absorb ultraviolet (UV) or visible (Vis) light, which relies on the electronic structure of the molecules. UV-Vis absorption requires the presence of conjugated pi-bond systems (i.e., chromophore) in the molecule, which are common in aromatic systems. Therefore, DOC quantified by the spectro::lyser is a proxy measure that represents the chromophoric component of DOM (CDOM), which is proportional to the samples' average aromaticity. The suite of molecules that comprise NOM generally have an aromatic character [@Weishaar2003]. Increasing aromaticity will lead to greater absorbance at longer wavelengths, therefore an absorbance spectrum can provide information about a samples molecular character. For example, absorption of near-UV wavelengths (i.e., 200-380 nm) is indicative of conjugated systems that are common to aromatic compounds; as such, specific UV absorbance at 254nm (SUVA~254~) has been adopted as a surrogate for DOM aromaticity and, to some extent, its reactivity [@Weishaar2003; @Chow2008]. The spectro::lyser measures absorbance from 200 nm to 750 nm wavelengths, across which several spectral indicies can be calculated. 


#####   SUVA~254~

Specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm (SUVA~254~) is the ratio of UV absorption (spectral absorbance coefficient, SAC, m^-1^) at 254nm wavelength, normalized to DOC concentration [@Weishaar2003]. SUVA~254~ is reported in units of liter per milligram carbon per meter (Lmg-C^-1^m^-1^) and was determined by dividing the UV absorbance measured at wavelength 254nm (SAC~254~) by DOC concentration ( mgL^-1^ as NPOC). SUVA~254~ correlates strongly with DOM aromaticity, and also with chemical reactivity [@Weishaar2003; @Helms2008; @Chow2008]. A higher SUVA value indicates greater aromaticity, and a lower SUVA value indicates more alliphatic DOM. Because humic substances (i.e., allochthonous NOM) are more aromatic, SUVA~254~ is a good indicator of humic sources of DOM [@Weishaar2003; @Vidon2008; @Abbott2018]. 

With respect to SUVA~254~ and drinking water treatability, it's important to consider the diversity of DOM and DBP species and the heterogeneous character contained in a water sample. While SUVA~254~ may indicate reactivity, it is not necessarily a strong indicator of DBP-FPs [@Weishaar2003; @Chow2008]. This is because some DBP precursor NOM components (e.g., alliphatics), which have negligible absorptivities in the UV-Vis range, may contribute to DBPs but not SUVA~254~; additionally, not all NOM with measurable SUVA~254~ will create DBPs [@Weishaar2003]. 


#####   Spectral indices of NOM character
	
Based on full scan data from the Spectrolyser (250-700nm), several indices of NOM character were determined. In the absence of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices, or high resolution spectrometric methods, spectral slopes are a simple tool for getting at molecule character. Spectral slopes (i.e., the change in absorbance intensity over a range of wavelengths) are semi-quantitative indicators for assessing DOM molecular size (weight) and aromaticity [@Helms2008]. 

Spectral slopes over the wavelength range of 275-295 nm (S~275-295~) and 350-400 nm (S~350-400~) were calculated from linear regression of log~e~-transformed spectral absorbance coefficients (m^-1^) as indicated by Helms [-@Helms2008, p 958]. Slope ratio (S~R~) is a unitless value equal to the ratio of S~275-295~ to S~350-400~ and is inversely proportional to CDOM molecular weight [@Helms2008]. A similar parameter is a quotient called E~2~:E~3~, which is the ratio of absorbances at wavelengths 250-nm and 365-nm, and is inversely related to aromaticity and molecular size of aquatic humic solutes [@Peuravuori1997; @Helms2008]. E~2~:E~3~ values were calculated, along with S~R~ , to try to elucidate molecular character of DOM in samples. 

#### Quality Assurance & Quality Control

UBC based laboratory QA/QC included analysis of blanks and replicate samples. A calibration curve was generated for the Shimadzu TOC-V each time the zero-air gas cylinder was replaced and accuracy was ensured with analysis of calibration verification standards. Analytical accuracy was determined to be 3.7% based on analysis of 20 calibration verification standards included throughout sample analyses.

The spectro::lyser has been shown to effectively determine DOC content and character on unfiltered samples [@Avagyan2014]. However, suspended matter may bias absorbance values due to non-DOC light absorption or scattering. Therefore, unfiltered water samples that had detectable turbidity (greater than 0.000 FTU) were removed from data analysis; this reduced the spectral dataset by 9.5%.

#####    Siphon sampler assumptions: vertical rack sampling 

Rising level siphon samplers collect water from approximately 5cm below the surface (top of intake tube to inlet orifice). Data related to rack samples relies on two key assumptions: the water column is well mixed (no stratification) therefore the sample is representative of water quality at each sampling stage; and the sample is discrete such that there is no infiltration or mixing after the sample is collected. Based on the turbulence associated with flows in the step-pool formation upstream of sampling locations, the assumption of fully mixed and unstratified water seems justified. The assumption of sample discretion was validated in lab using food colouring and a flow-through bucket system where a tap water sample was collected by siphon sample bottle, food colouring was added to flow system after sample collection and circulated for 15 minutes, then the sample bottle was removed from dye chamber and the colour of the sample was compared to surrounding dyed water. There was no dye present in sample bottle following this test, which was repeated five times with different siphon-lid bottles. 

#####    Sample hold-times and temperatures: vertical rack sampling

Every effort was made to retrieve rack samples as quickly as possible from the racks; none the less, some samples remained on a rack for more than a few days due to logistical, access and safety considerations. Hobo TidbiT temperature sensors were deployed at each vertical rack to monitor air and water temperature, which was used in estimates of sample stability between sample collection and retrieval from racks. 

Hold-time experiments were performed to assess sample stability. The hold-time experiments included replicate sample (n = 10) collection at a site, where half the samples were placed out of water on the vertical rack with siphon lids and the other half were returned to the lab for immediate analysis. Three hold-time experiments were completed such that the rack samples were left in the field for 11, 20 and 34 days before being retrieved and analyzed in comparison to their counterpart replicates (details in results section).  

#### Random Forests

A collection of decision trees is a Random Forest, which play an important role for both predictive modeling and inference purposes. 

The Breiman's Random Forests (RF) is a machine learning algorithm for practical applications, which is popular for its accuracy in real-world systems [@Tyralis2019; @Biau2016]. In RF, a set of predictor variables (features) are used to predict the outcome of another variable (the predictant) through supervised learning algorithms, grouped as either regression or classification, depending on whether the variables are quantitative (i.e. numeric) or qualitative [@Breiman2001; @Tyralis2019]. 

The RF algorithm learns from many independent Classification And Regression Trees (CARTs) which undergo bootstrap-aggregating ("bagging") with randomization; meaning that no single tree includes all the data, which reduces over-fitting and improves prediction performance [@Breiman2001; @Tyralis2019; @Biau2016]. 

IN RF, many decision tree area created, each one generated by randomly sampling from the full data set (with replacement) and each tree is trained until only one possible solution remains (i.e., leaf nodes contain one deciding variable). For problems of regression (i.e., quantitative numeric variables, such as the data in this thesis), the forest prediction is the average of the individual trees predictions [@Tyralis2019; @Biau2016]. 

The relative importance of each feature is determined by assessing the accuracy of how well the predictant variable is anticipated in the absence of that feature. 

The R package RandomForest was built on Breiman's Random Forests algorithm. RandomForest was used to determine the relative importance of watershed characteristics and conditions in determining DOC concentrations and DOM character in across the six sites of the LWSA.
