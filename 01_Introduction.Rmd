##	Introduction & background

###	Forested source water supplies and drinking water treatment 
	

Drinking water in Canada is primarily sourced from surface water supplies. Over 85% of Canadians, and approximately 80% of British Columbians depend on drinking water that originates from forested headwaters [@Pike2010]. Forests offer a variety of ecosystem services (e.g. biodiversity) and also slow and filter runoff which can result in high quality source water supply [@Dudley2003]. Climate, weather, and physical characteristics of a watershed (such as topography, land cover and geology) lead to spatial and temporal variations in surface water quality, and runoff links surface waters to the terrestrial landscape by introducing sediments, nutrients, and organic matter into solution [@Pike2010; @Johnson1997; @Delpla2016; @HealthCanada2019; @Yang2015; @Matilainen2010]. 

\  

In Canada, all drinking water must meet Health Canada drinking water quality guidelines, which specify allowable levels of biological, physical and chemical parameters that are safe for human use and consumption [@BC2019; @HealthLinkBC2018; @HealthCanada2019a]. To meet guidelines, source water is most commonly treated to remove substances which may pose a health risk. Drinking water treatment processes vary from simple chlorination to combinations of physical filtration, chemically assisted filtration, reverse osmosis, and or advanced oxidative processes [@MWH2014; @Emelko2011]. Drinking water treatment technologies differ between communities by infrastructure design and operation, which may be guided by source water quality, infrastructure capabilities, budget, regional size and  water quality regulations [@Emelko2011]. All drinking water treatment processes share the same goal: ensure public health by providing a continuous supply of safe water. While there are guidelines for radiological, chemical and physical parameters (e.g. removal of metals), the highest priority drinking water guidelines focus on the inactivation of potentially harmful microorganisms, therefore disinfection is the most important step in the treatment process [@MWH2014; @HealthCanada2019a]. In BC, chlorination remains the most widely used method of disinfection, whether it is used alone or in combination with other treatment processes, such as those mentioned above [@HealthCanada2006; @HealthLinkBC2018]. 

\  

Because drinking water treatment requirements vary with source water quality, there are source water quality guidelines in place in addition to those for treated drinking water quality [@HealthLinkBC2018; @BC2019]. Stable source water conditions lead to predictable treatment procedures, while fluctuating source water quality creates treatment challenges [@Emelko2011]. Treatment effectiveness is influenced, for example, by turbidity levels (i.e. suspended solids), varying temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and dissolved natural organic matter.

\  

####   Aqueous natural organic matter in source water supply

Natural organic matter (NOM) comprises a dynamic collection of molecules that originate from a variety of sources, and aqueous NOM exists in complex and diverse combinations of particulate, colloidal and dissolved fractions [@Peuravuori1997 ;@Aiken2011; @Matilainen2011; @Ruhala2017]. NOM can be introduced to a water body from terrestrial sources (i.e. allochthonous NOM) or generated through in-stream processes (i.e. autochthonous NOM) which are often associated with autotrophic organisms like algae and cyanobacteria [@HealthCanada2019; @Epps1994]. Terrestrial organic matter (allochthonous NOM) includes humic and fluvic acids, tannins, and a wide variety of other compounds (e.g. phenols and lignin, hydrocarbons, proteins, carbohydrates, etc.), which enter fresh water through runoff [@Zarnetske2018; @HealthCanada2019]. 

\  

NOM concentration and character vary widely in source water depending on source material, hydrology, and biogeochemical factors [@Aiken2011; @Abbott2018; @Zarnetske2018; @Matilainen2010]. Molecular composition and physical structure of NOM influence its functionality and reactivity, therefore different types of aqueous NOM in drinking source water have different disinfection by-product formation potentials (DBP-FPs) [@Delpla2016; @Yang2015; @HealthCanada2019; @Chow2008], and different aquatic ecosystem roles [@Cory2011]. Furthermore, different species of NOM vary in molecular size, structure and charge distribution, which determine requirements for effective treatment and removal [@Jacangelo1995; @Matilainen2010].  

\  

Molecular structures of NOM can contain nitrogen, silica, oxygen and hydrogen and are composed primarily of carbon; thus, organic carbon (OC) is often quantified as a proxy for NOM concentration [@Cory2011; @HealthCanada2019; @Matilainen2010; @MWH2014]. Total organic carbon (TOC) is operationally divided into particulate and dissolved fractions (POC and DOC, respectively) which are typically distinguished based on separation by a 0.45-micron filter [@StdMet5310; @Aiken2011]. Generally, DOC is the predominant fraction of TOC in surface water, and the amount of DBPs in treated water is proportional to raw water DOC concentration [@Weishaar2003; @Ruhala2017; @Chow2008]. 

\  

In addition to acting as a precursor for DBPs, DOC (thus NOM) has been called a master variable due to it's terrestrial-aquatic linkages, influence on water chemistry and role in contaminant transport [@Zarnetske2018; @Ruhala2017]. NOM is an energy source for aquatic heterotrophs, it has the ability to bind and transport contaminants in solution (e.g. metals, hydrophobic organic pollutants, nutrients), can influence stream pH and aquatic light and temperature regimes; which, in turn, effect aquatic microbial communities [@Matilainen2010; @Oni2013; @Aiken2011; @Weishaar2003; @LaZerte1991; @Palleiro2013; @Stanley2012; @Cory2011]. 

\  

DOC is an important source water quality parameter to monitor and guidelines in British Columbia specify that drinking source water TOC should remain below 4 mg/L, primarily to reduce the production of trihalomethanes (e.g. chloroform, a common DBP) in treated drinking water [@BC2019]. Aside from DBPs, monitoring source water DOC is important for addressing other operational issues associated with NOM and drinking water treatment challenges. Within a watershed, the characteristics and concentrations of NOM (and therefore DOC) naturally fluctuate over space and through time, creating dynamic conditions and potential treatability concerns [@Li2014; @Yang2015].

\  

...

\  

Aqueous natural organic matter (NOM) can lead to issues of objectionable taste, odour and colour (i.e. guideline aesthetic objectives) and while these aesthetic issues may create unpalatable drinking water, they do not directly impact human health [@HealthCanada2019; @HealthCanada2019a]. However, source water NOM can interfere with effective drinking water treatment, so BC source drinking water quality guidelines include colour as an indicator of aqueous NOM [@BC2019; @HealthCanada2019]. Depending on infrastructure design and operation of a drinking water treatment plant, elevated levels of NOM in source water can increase coagulant demand which increases the production of sludge (to be disposed of) and promote the formation of disinfection by-products [@Matilainen2010; @HealthCanada2019]. NOM reduces treatment effectiveness by interfering with ultraviolet (UV) disinfection and/or increasing chlorination demand; NOM can effect coagulation efficiency and oxidative processes; and because NOM promotes biological growth, it can lead to fouling of treatment and distribution infrastructure [@BC2019; @Matilainen2010; @HealthCanada2019; @Jacangelo1995].

\  

In addition to operational impediments, NOM is partly responsible for unintended chemical contaminants in treated drinking water. When source water is chlorinated, chemical reactions with NOM can form a variety of chlorinated organic compounds which are broadly classified as disinfection by-products (DBPs) [@Richardson2007; @Delpla2016; @HealthCanada2019; @Yang2015; @Hua2015; @StdMet5310]. A number of chlorinated carbonaceous DBPs are included in Health Canada's drinking water quality guidelines, and have maximum allowable concentrations in treated water due to their possible or known health affects (i.e. possible genotoxicity or carcinogenicity) [@Richardson2007; @BC2019; @HealthCanada2019].

\  
 
####   Watershed processes and water quality
	
Streams are intrinsically linked to their watersheds through dynamic biotic-abiotic interactions and hydroclimatic relationships; as a result, aqueous biogeochemicals like natural organic matter represent an important link between ecosystem processes, land-use, hydrology, and water resources. These water-quality signatures are useful tracers to better understand catchment processes and regional hydrology, as they are indicative of flow paths, sources, chemical origins and transport pathways [@Abbott2018; @Meyer1983; @Vidon2008; @Rautu2019]. The origins, transport and fate of biogeochemicals in source waters is important for drinking water treatment, because the quality of source water (physiochemical composition and concentrations) governs treatment requirements and largely dictates the quality of treated water [@Weishaar2003; @Chow2008]. Natural organic matter (NOM) encompasses a suite of biogeochemical compounds that link terrestrial and aquatic environments, with runoff introducing terrestrial compounds into fluvial systems and transporting both allochthonous and autochthonous compounds.    

\  

NOM exhibits dynamic variability across watersheds. The river continuum concept (RCC) predicts a temporal shift in NOM character, including seasonal shifts between autotrophic generation of NOM and heterotrophic processing of detritus; a shift from autochthonous to allochthonous NOM [@Vannote1980; @Meyer1983]. The RCC also predicts a spatial reduction in NOM molecular diversity from headwaters (entry point for majority of solutes) to river mouth (i.e. reduced NOM diversity from low to high order streams) [@Vannote1980; @Mosher2015; @Abbott2018; @Creed2015]. The longitudinal attenuation of NOM diversity can be explained by a combination of hydrological processes; geomorphic variables and physical impoundments; organic matter inputs and sources; sediment transport; solar inputs; and processing by aquatic invertebrates and microbes [@Vannote1980; @Stanley2012; @Aiken2011; @Zarnetske2018]. 

\  

On a finer temporal scale, hydrologic pulses can cause temporal variability in NOM characteristics; for example, the character of NOM has been shown to vary during hydrologic response to precipitation, which indicates a change in NOM source over the course of an event [@Vidon2008; @Abbott2018]. The Pulse Shunt Concept supplements the temporal aspects of RCC by considering how major hydrologic events drive regional NOM metabolism and the magnitude, timing and spatial extent of NOM flux [@Raymond2016]. While the link between mobilization of source material and biogeochemical processes govern the character of aqueous NOM, the Pulse Shunt Concept (PSC) shows that it is hydrologic processes that govern NOM concentrations in streams [@Abbott2018; @Creed2015; @Zarnetske2018]. Where the RCC relies on in-stream biogeochemical processing to explain longitudinal alteration of NOM character, intense hydrologic pulses (related to precipitation or melt events) override the rate of biogeochemical processing and force mass transport events. Discharge determines the magnitude of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux (i.e. concentration transport) and under pluvial regime, precipitation and discharge are the primary controls on stream DOC concentrations [@Zarnetske2018; @Vidon2008]. Indeed, brief flood events are often responsible for most of the fluvial DOC transport in a watershed [@Raymond2010]. With respect to drinking water supply, the timing and magnitude of DOC flux is important for water treatment considerations because while treatment infrastructure can be designed and adjusted to handle a range of source water conditions, rapid changes and dramatic variations in source water quality pose major challenges for drinking water treatment {REF}.   

\  

Through a large and geographically diverse data study in the United States, Zarnetske _et al_ [-@Zarnetske2018] found that increasing flows systematically increased DOC fluxes in 80% of watersheds (n=1006) across ecoregions. Proportional increases in DOC flux and discharge indicates that the flux is not limited by organic matter supply, but rather by hydrologic connectivity and mobilization [@Creed2015; @Zarnetske2018]. Watershed size and stream order were determined to be weak indicators of DOC flux-discharge relationship while watershed slope and mean precipitation were strong predictors of DOC flux [e.g. @Zarnetske2018 ___add more refs___]. Zarnetske _et al_ [-@Zarnetske2018] also found that wetland area exerted non-linear control over whether DOC flux was limited by supply or hydrologic transport. 

\  

Aspects of both the RCC and PSC were illustrated in a recent nested catchment study by Abbott _et al_ [-@Abbott2018] which found greater NOM chemical diversity in headwaters relative to downstream, but not greater temporal variance in headwaters biogeochemistry. Despite longitudinal differences in molecular character, solute concentrations varied synchronously among upstream and downstream sites, leading to temporal stability in relative biogeochemical signatures [@Abbott2018]. The temporal extent to which water quality changes echo across nested sub-catchments depends on the synchrony (i.e. mean covariance) of the hydrologic pulse generation among sub-catchments [@Abbott2018]. 

\  

Changing climatic conditions are likely to lead to increases in hydrologic pulse generation -- through increased precipitation, earlier or more intense freshet conditions, or changes in subsurface flow and connectivity [@ ? *refs*]-- it follows that drinking water treatment challenges could arise in response to more variable source water conditions. For forested source water supply areas, developing a better understanding of hydrochemical dynamics and their responses to landscape changes (e.g. wildfire, forest management strategies, mass wasting events) could bolster drinking water security by developing source water protection plans to facilitate more predictable treatment requirements. Understanding water supply area source water quality, variability and response patterns is an important part of the multi-barrier approach to safe drinking water [@CCME2004]. 

\  

Forest management and landscape disturbances can also affect water quality by altering material inputs, biogeochemical processes and stream ecology, as well as changing preferential flow-paths and the mobilization, transport and dilution of biogeochemical components [@Meyer1983]. For example, wildfire combined with post-fire salvage logging in the slopes of Alberta's southern Rockies resulted in higher turbidity and DOC compared to basins that experienced fire without salvage logging, and both disturbed basins had elevated suspended solids and DOC compared to un-burned catchments [@Emelko2011; *more refs*]. In other studies, it was shown that two to three years post-harvest, baseflow DOC concentrations were higher in forested catchments than in clear-cut catchments; however, these studies also showed variable stormflow DOC responses in harvested and forested catchments [@Meyer1983; @Mistick2019]. In the absence of long-term baseline data (i.e. pre- and post-disturbance data sets), the natural variability in fluvial processes complicates land-use studies and anthropogenic climate change can further confound our interpretations. Overall, DOC trends related to land-use are highly dependent on catchment attributes and hydrologic forces. Understanding the hydrochemistry of a water supply area is key to conducting informed preventative forest management applications.

\  


### Surface water sampling strategies

\  

A discrete water sample cannot tell a complete story of a hydrologic system's water quality dynamics but it can provide information about specific attributes of the water in a given place at a certain time, if it accurately represent the body from which it was collected. Non-representative sampling techniques will lead to non-representative analytical results and ultimately to erroneous conclusions [@CCME2011]. Collection of water samples must be done consistently and carefully to avoid sample contamination or sampling errors which would generate unreliable analytical results [@CCME2011]. In a carbon-based world, sample contamination must be a crucial and constant consideration when sampling for NOM [@CCME2011; @Cory2011]. 

\  

The basis of a water quality monitoring network is the collection of representative quantitative data for physical, chemical or biological parameters that help to characterize a hydrologic system over time [@Strobl2008a]. A monitoring network, therefore, will involve some form of a sampling program and it's design should reflect research objectives, account for physical realities (e.g. spatiotemporal heterogeneity, access), while being cost-effective and practical [@Strobl2008a; @Kirchner2006]. Grab-sampling is a standard method of collecting whole-water samples for laboratory or stream-side analysis [@CCME2011; @Ruhala2017]. Synoptic grab sampling can be completed at a number of sites over a relatively short period of time (e.g. hours to days) to assess spatial variations, however there is often a lack of temporal resolution due to scheduled, convenient or opportunistic sampling at relatively low frequencies [@Ruhala2017]. 

\  

It can be difficult to schedule a synoptic sampling campaign for specific weather and flow conditions, especially for short duration of rapid runoff (@Harmel2003). Flow changes in response to precipitation or melt events are of interest for NOM studies as the rising limb of the hydrograph has been shown to have higher DOC concentration that non-storm flow [@Yang2015; @Raymond2016; @Raymond2010]. While high flows present an opportunity to capture the dynamic water quality changes that occur during events, it is logistically challenging and potentially dangerous to manually collect grab samples during events across multiple sites (@Graczyk2000; @Mackay2012). So, pump samplers or passive siphon samplers can be used to collect water samples under difficult or unsafe conditions. 

\  

A pump sampler (e.g. ISCO samplers, Teledyne ISCO, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA; or Global Water Instrumentation, Gold River, California) can be set up in the field and programmed to collect a set of water samples based on time intervals or changes in conditions (e.g. stage or turbidity thresholds). Pump samplers are effective for automatic event-based sampling (@Harmel2003) but can be prohibitively expensive ($2K-3K CAD), and also require a reliable power source which can pose logistical challenged for setting up at multiple sites in remote or difficult to access locations (@Mackay2012). A passive siphon sampler is an alternative to a pump sampler that automatically and effectively collects discrete water samples on the rising limb of the hydrograph (e.g.: @Mackay2012; @Graczyk2000; @Diehl2007). Siphon samplers are limited to sampling a single event and (so far) are not suitable for sampling the falling hydrograph limb; they are however very low cost, customizable and require no power [@Newham2001].

###    Source water considerations for Greater Victoria's water supply areas

The Capital Regional District (CRD), encompassing the southern tip of Vancouver Island (including Victoria) and the southern Gulf Islands,  is committed to the multiple barrier approach to clean drinking water and has taken control of source water protection by purchasing and privatizing the water supply areas for Greater Victoria. Located on southeastern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, the Greater Victoria Water Supply Area (GVWSA) includes 20,549 hectares (205.49 km^2^) of protected drinking water catchment lands. Currently, Greater Victoria's water supply is sourced from five surface water reservoirs in the Sooke and Goldstream watersheds; Sooke Reservoir is the primary drinking water supply. 

\  

The provincial Drinking Water Protection Act and Drinking Water Protection Regulation frameworks were developed to implement Health Canada's drinking water quality guidelines and set out requirements for drinking water operators & suppliers to ensure the provision of safe drinking water [@BC2019]. Treatment of source water from the Greater Victoria Water Supply Area consists only of disinfection: raw water (unfiltered) is treated with ultraviolet light as primary disinfection, chlorination is secondary, and finally ammonia is added to produce chloramine (NH~2~Cl, a long-lasting disinfectant that persists throughout the distribution system). 

\  

In anticipation of future water demands and uncertainty related to rainfall and climate change, the Capital Regional District (CRD) purchased an additional 96.28 km^2^ of land in 2007 and 2010. This area includes about 92% of the Leech River watershed (~96 km^2^) which was designated as the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA) for future supplemental source water. In the future (possibly by 2050), inter-basin transfer will move water from the LWSA through a diversion tunnel to supplement Sooke Reservoir (Figure \@ref(fig:GVWSAoverview)). Approximately 92% of the Leech River watershed above the point of diversion (Leech Tunnel) is protected as WSA. 

\  

```{r GVWSAoverview, out.width = "50%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}

```

\  

The LWSA was privately managed forest land which was extensively harvested over the past 70 years (nearly 96% clearcut); as a result, a large portion of the WSA is densely forested with softwood stands around 50 years of age, as of 2020. The second growth forests of the LWSA are no longer managed for timber supply, but rather to improve and maintain drinking source water quality and to reduce the risk of landscape level wildfire. Due to prior harvest, reforestation and active fire suppression, forest fire fuels have accumulated in the LWSA and pose a threat if a fire occurs. In the Sooke WSA, the CRD implements forest treatments designed to foster healthy forest stands capable of reducing fire intensity, such as reducing fuel hazards and creating conditions that are safe for crews to action a fire (e.g. closed-canopy fuel breaks). Similar preventative fire treatments may be applied in the LWSA prior to inter-basin transfers. 

\  

Hydrology and water quality monitoring programs for the Leech began in 2017, thus there is little historical data to describe hydrochemical dynamics in the Leech watershed. Observations through this master's research showed that runoff is greatest in the winter when rivers respond rapidly to precipitation events, rising and falling ___dramatically___. 
...
In the mid-1980’s, some water was transferred from the Leech River into Deception Gulch and Reservoir (adjacent to but physically separated from Sooke Reservoir), and the mixing resulted in biological water quality problems that included odour and raised concerns about the operational usage of the existing tunnel [___personal communication ?refs_*___]. Before work is done on inter-basin transfers, the hydrology and water quality of the Leech River system need to be better understood. 
...
An understanding of water quality and hydrology in the LWSA will help to inform forest management strategies and evaluate the effects of fire fuel management on water supply. 
...
Furthermore, describing relationships between event-based water quality dynamics and  hydrochemical ranges across the LWSA will help to anticipate possible treatment challenges that could accompany future inter-basin transfer from the LWSA to the Sooke WSA.

\  

###   Research questions and objectives

This research was conducted in partnership with the CRD and forWater Network to better understand variations in source water quality across a second growth forested watershed, primarily with respect to DOC and NOM in relation to streamflow. This thesis tackled four research questions (RQ) and associated objectives (below), each of which is addressed in subsequent chapters.

\  

*__RQ.1.__   How do DOC concentrations and NOM character vary among adjacent drainage basins and across nested sub-catchments in the Greater Victoria water supply area, and what influence does seasonality have on concentration of DOC and character of NOM?

*__Objective 1:__   Design a sampling strategy to describe spatial and temporal patterns and variation of DOC concentrations and NOM character.

\  

*__RQ.2.__   What are the primary drivers (e.g. watershed characteristics or conditions) for changes in DOC and NOM in the Leech watershed?

*__Objective 2:__   Relate water sample results to watershed characteristics and conditions to report on relationships between DOC, NOM and key variables, including differences between baseflow and storm events.

\  

__RQ.3.__   What are the implications for watershed management and future drinking water supply?

__Objective 3:__   Provide context of how results can be used to inform watershed management planning for wildfire reduction strategies and design of continued water quality monitoring for future inter-basin transfers.

\  

Results of this research will contribute to baseline understanding for further exploration of forest management strategies, such as fire fuel management, and their impacts on source water quality and supply. Understanding source water quality in relation to hydrology is an essential component to multiple barrier approach to ensuring clean drinking water.
