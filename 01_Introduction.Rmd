##	Introduction & background

###	Forested source water supplies and drinking water treatment 
	

Drinking water in Canada is primarily sourced from surface water supplies. Over 85% of Canadians, and approximately 80% of British Columbians depend on drinking water that originates from forested headwaters [@Pike2010]. Forests offer a variety of ecosystem services (e.g. biodiversity) and also slow and filter runoff which can result in high quality source water supply [@Dudley2003]. Climate, weather, and physical characteristics of a watershed (such as topography, land cover and geology) lead to spatial and temporal variations in surface water quality, and runoff links surface waters to the terrestrial landscape by introducing sediments, nutrients, and organic matter into solution [@Pike2010; @Johnson1997; @Delpla2016; @HealthCanada2019; @Yang2015; @Matilainen2010]. 

\  

In Canada, all drinking water must meet Health Canada drinking water quality guidelines, which specify allowable levels of biological, physical and chemical parameters that are safe for human use and consumption [@BC2019; @HealthLinkBC2018; @HealthCanada2019a]. To meet guidelines, source water is commonly treated to remove substances which may pose a health risk. Drinking water treatment processes vary from simple chlorination to combinations of physical filtration, chemically assisted filtration, reverse osmosis, and or advanced oxidative processes [@MWH2014; @Emelko2011]. Drinking water treatment technologies differ between communities by infrastructure design and operation, which may be guided by source water quality, infrastructure capabilities, budget, regional size and  water quality regulations [@Emelko2011]. All drinking water treatment processes share the same goal: ensure public health by providing a continuous supply of safe water. There are guidelines for radiological, chemical and physical parameters (e.g. removal of metals), but the drinking water guidelines with highest priority are those that focus on inactivation of potentially harmful microorganisms; therefore, disinfection is the most important step in the treatment process [@MWH2014; @HealthCanada2019a]. In British Columbia, chlorination remains the most widely used method of disinfection, whether it is used alone or in combination with other treatment processes, such as those mentioned above [@HealthCanada2006; @HealthLinkBC2018]. 

\  

Drinking water treatment requirements vary with source water quality, thus guidelines are in place for source water as well as those for treated drinking water [@HealthLinkBC2018; @BC2019]. Stable source water conditions lead to predictable treatment procedures, while fluctuating source water quality can create treatment challenges [@Emelko2011]. Treatment effectiveness is influenced, for example, by turbidity levels (i.e. suspended solids), varying temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and dissolved natural organic matter.

\  

####   Aqueous natural organic matter in drinking source water supply

Natural organic matter (NOM) comprises a dynamic collection of molecules that originate from a variety of sources, and aqueous NOM exists in complex and diverse combinations of particulate, colloidal and dissolved fractions [@Peuravuori1997; @Aiken2011; @Matilainen2011; @Ruhala2017]. NOM can be introduced to a water body from terrestrial sources (i.e. allochthonous NOM) or generated through in-stream processes (i.e. autochthonous NOM) which are often associated with autotrophic organisms like algae and cyanobacteria [@HealthCanada2019; @Epps1994]. Terrestrial organic matter (allochthonous NOM) includes humic and fluvic acids, tannins, and a wide variety of other compounds (e.g. phenols and lignin, hydrocarbons, proteins, carbohydrates, etc.), which enter fresh water through runoff [@Zarnetske2018; @HealthCanada2019]. 

\  

For drinking water, NOM can lead to issues of objectionable taste, odour and colour (i.e. guideline aesthetic objectives) and while these aesthetic issues may create unpalatable drinking water, they do not directly impact human health [@HealthCanada2019; @HealthCanada2019a]. However, source water NOM can interfere with effective drinking water treatment. Depending on infrastructure design and operation of a drinking water treatment plant, elevated levels of NOM in source water can affect coagulation efficiency and increase coagulant demand and the resulting production of sludge (to be disposed of). NOM in source water reduces treatment effectiveness by interfering with oxidative processes such as ultraviolet (UV) disinfection and/or increasing chlorination demand and promoting the formation of disinfection by-products [@Matilainen2010; @HealthCanada2019]. Furthermore, NOM promotes biological growth, which can lead to bio-fouling of treatment and distribution infrastructure [@BC2019; @Matilainen2010; @HealthCanada2019; @Jacangelo1995]. 

\  

Molecular structures of NOM can contain varying ratios of nitrogen, silica, oxygen and hydrogen and are composed primarily of carbon; thus, organic carbon is often quantified as a proxy for NOM concentration [@Cory2011; @HealthCanada2019; @Matilainen2010; @MWH2014]. Total organic carbon (TOC) is operationally divided into particulate and dissolved fractions (POC and DOC, respectively) which are typically distinguished based on separation by a 0.45-micron filter [@StdMet5310; @Aiken2011]. Generally, DOC is the predominant fraction of TOC in surface water, and the amount of DBPs in treated water is proportional to raw water DOC concentration [@Weishaar2003; @Ruhala2017; @Chow2008]. 

\  

In addition to acting as a precursor for DBPs, DOC (thus NOM) has been called a master variable (or the “great modulator”) due to it's terrestrial-aquatic linkages, influence on water chemistry and role in contaminant transport [@Stanley2012; @Zarnetske2018; @Ruhala2017]. NOM is an energy source for aquatic heterotrophs, it has the ability to bind and transport contaminants in solution (e.g. metals, hydrophobic organic pollutants, nutrients), can influence stream pH and aquatic light and temperature regimes which, in turn, effect aquatic microbial communities [@Matilainen2010; @Oni2013; @Aiken2011; @Weishaar2003; @LaZerte1991; @Palleiro2013; @Stanley2012; @Cory2011]. 

\  

Potential treatability concerns could result from the dynamic natural fluctuations in NOM character and concentrations across a water supply area and over time [@Li2014; @Yang2015]. Therefore, DOC is an important source water quality parameter to monitor and guidelines in BC specify that drinking source water TOC should remain below 4 mg/L, primarily to reduce the production of trihalomethanes (e.g. chloroform, a common DBP) in treated drinking water [@BC2019]. Aside from DBPs, monitoring source water DOC is important for addressing other operational issues that could arise from NOM in source water. Furthermore, site-specific knowledge of relationships between DOC and other water quality parameters or contaminants could allow for extrapolation, if indeed DOC is a master variable. 

\ 

NOM concentration and character vary widely in source water depending on source material, hydrology, and biogeochemical factors [@Aiken2011; @Abbott2018; @Zarnetske2018; @Matilainen2010]. The molecular composition and physical structure of NOM influence its functionality and reactivity, therefore different types of aqueous NOM in drinking source water have different disinfection by-product formation potentials (DBP-FPs) [@Delpla2016; @Yang2015; @HealthCanada2019; @Chow2008], and different aquatic ecosystem roles [@Cory2011]. Furthermore, different species of NOM vary in molecular size, structure and charge distribution, which determine requirements for effective treatment and removal [@Jacangelo1995; @Matilainen2010].  

\
 
##### Spectroscopic assessment of NOM   

The molecular structure of NOM can be assessed through spectrophotometry. For NOM to be detected by UV-Vis spectroscopy the molecules must absorb ultraviolet (UV) or visible (Vis) light, which is a physiochemical ability determined by the molecules electronic structure. UV-Vis absorption requires the presence of a conjugated pi-bond system (i.e. a chromophore), which is common in aromatic molecules. The wavelength of light absorption is proportional to the length of the molecule's conjugated system -- that is, a larger and/or more aromatic molecule will absorb UV-Vis light at longer wavelengths than a smaller, less aromatic molecule. So, higher molecular weight (chromophoric) NOM molecules will have stronger light absorption at longer wavelengths [@Helms2008]. A more concentrated sample will also lead to greater absorption intensity. Therefore, the UV-Vis spectrum of a water sample can provide valuable information about relative weights, aromaticity and relative concentrations of aqueous NOM [@Helms2008; @Cory2011; @Agren2008; @Karanfil2002; @Karanfil2003]. DOC concentration can be estimated from UV-Vis absorbance; a proxy that represents the chromophoric component of NOM which is proportional to the samples' average aromatic carbon component [@Helms2008]. 

\  

UV absorbance at 254 nm has been shown to correlate strongly with NOM aromaticity [@Weishaar2003]. Because allochthonous NOM (i.e. humic substances) are more aromatic than aliphatic, the specific absorbance coefficient at 254 nm (SAC~254~, absorbance relative to pathlength) is a good indicator of terrestrial sources of NOM [@Weishaar2003; @Vidon2008; @Abbott2018]. Specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA~254~) is a widely adopted indicator of NOM character that measures the aromatic content of a sample per unit concentration of organic carbon (e.g. @Weishaar2003; @Chow2008), it is the ratio of the SAC~254~ normalized to the samples DOC concentration. SUVA~254~ is calculated by dividing SAC~254~ by DOC concentration (mgL^-1^) and has units of liter per milligram carbon per meter (Lmg-C^-1^m^-1^, i.e. L/mg-m) [@Weishaar2003; @Karanfil2003]. SUVA~254~ has been shown to correlate strongly with aromaticity and also with chemical reactivity [@Weishaar2003; @Helms2008; @Chow2008]. 

\  

With respect to SUVA~254~ and drinking water treatability, it's important to consider the diversity of DOM and DBP species and the heterogeneous character contained in a water sample. While SUVA~254~ may indicate reactivity, it is not necessarily a strong indicator of disinfection by-product formation potentials (DBP-FPs) [@Weishaar2003; @Chow2008]. This is because some DBP precursor NOM components which have negligible absorptivity in the UV-Vis range (e.g. aliphatic components) may contribute to DBPs but not SUVA~254~ [@Owen1995]; additionally, not all NOM with measurable SUVA~254~ will create DBPs [@Weishaar2003]. Therefore, SUVA~254~ (or simply SAC~254~) should be interpreted primarily as an indicator of molecular aromaticity. Aside from DBPs, NOM aromaticity and size are important when considering other treatability factors such as biofouling, filter clogging and interference with UV disinfection.

\  

The slope of absorbances over certain wavelength ranges (e.g. 275-295 nm (S~275-295~) or 350-400 nm (S~350-400~)) are inversely proportional to (chromophoric) NOM molecular weight [@Helms2008]. A spectral quotient called E~2~:E~3~ is a similar parameter which is more straight-forward to calculate. E~2~:E~3~ is the ratio of absorbance at 250 nm to 365 nm and is inversely related to aromaticity and molecular size of aquatic humic solutes [@Peuravuori1997; @Helms2008]. 

\  

####   Watershed processes and water quality
	
Streams are intrinsically linked to their watersheds through dynamic biotic-abiotic interactions and hydroclimatic relationships; as a result, aqueous biogeochemicals like natural organic matter represent an important link between ecosystem processes, land-use, hydrology, and water resources. These water-quality signatures are useful tracers to better understand catchment processes and regional hydrology, as they are indicative of flow paths, sources, chemical origins and transport pathways [@Abbott2018; @Meyer1983; @Vidon2008; @Rautu2019].    

\  

NOM exhibits dynamic variability across watersheds. The river continuum concept (RCC) predicts a temporal shift in NOM character, including seasonal shifts between autotrophic generation of NOM and heterotrophic processing of detritus; that is, a shift from autochthonous to allochthonous NOM [@Vannote1980; @Meyer1983]. The RCC also predicts a spatial reduction in NOM molecular diversity from lower-order headwater streams (the entry point for many solutes) to higher-order streams [@Vannote1980; @Mosher2015; @Abbott2018; @Creed2015]. The longitudinal attenuation of NOM diversity can be explained by a combination of hydrological processes; geomorphic variables and physical impoundments; organic matter inputs and sources; sediment transport; solar inputs; and processing by aquatic invertebrates and microbes [@Vannote1980; @Stanley2012; @Aiken2011; @Zarnetske2018]. 

\  

On a finer temporal scale, hydrologic pulses can cause temporal variability in NOM characteristics and concentrations. For example, the character of NOM has been shown to vary during hydrologic response to precipitation, which indicates a change in NOM source over the course of an event [@Zarnetske2018; @Vidon2008; @Abbott2018]. The Pulse Shunt Concept supplements the temporal aspects of RCC by considering how major hydrologic events drive regional NOM metabolism and the magnitude, timing and spatial extent of NOM flux [@Raymond2016]. While the link between mobilization of source material and biogeochemical processes govern the character of aqueous NOM, the Pulse Shunt Concept (PSC) shows that it is hydrologic processes that govern NOM concentrations in streams [@Abbott2018; @Creed2015; @Zarnetske2018]. Where the RCC relies on in-stream biogeochemical processing to explain longitudinal alteration of NOM character, intense hydrologic pulses (related to precipitation or melt events) override the rate of biogeochemical processing and force mass transport events. Discharge determines the magnitude of DOC flux (i.e. concentration transport) and under pluvial regime, precipitation and discharge are the primary controls on stream DOC concentrations [@Zarnetske2018; @Vidon2008]. Indeed, brief flood events are often responsible for most of the fluvial DOC transport in a watershed [@Raymond2010]. With respect to drinking water supply, the timing and magnitude of DOC flux is important for water treatment considerations because while treatment infrastructure can be designed and adjusted to handle a range of source water conditions, rapid changes and dramatic variations in source water quality could pose major challenges for drinking water treatment [@Matilainen2010].   

\  

Through a large and geographically diverse data study in the United States, Zarnetske et al. [-@Zarnetske2018] found that increasing flows systematically increased DOC fluxes in 80% of watersheds (_n_=1006) across ecoregions. Proportional increases in DOC flux and discharge indicates that the flux is not limited by organic matter supply, but rather by hydrologic connectivity and mobilization [@Creed2015; @Zarnetske2018]. Watershed size and stream order were determined to be weak indicators of DOC flux-discharge relationship while watershed slope and mean precipitation were strong predictors of DOC flux [e.g. @Zarnetske2018]. Zarnetske et al. [-@Zarnetske2018] also found that wetland area exerted non-linear control over whether DOC flux was limited by supply or hydrologic transport. 

\  

Aspects of both the RCC and PSC were illustrated in a recent nested catchment study by Abbott et al. [-@Abbott2018] which found greater NOM chemical diversity in headwaters relative to downstream, but not greater temporal variance in headwaters biogeochemistry. Despite longitudinal differences in molecular character, solute concentrations varied synchronously among upstream and downstream sites, leading to stability in relative biogeochemical signatures over time [@Abbott2018]. The temporal extent to which water quality changes echo across nested sub-catchments depends on the synchrony (i.e. mean covariance) of the hydrologic pulse generation among sub-catchments [@Abbott2018]. 

\  

Forest management and landscape disturbances can also affect water quality by altering material inputs, biogeochemical processes and stream ecology, as well as changing preferential flow-paths and the mobilization, transport and dilution of biogeochemical components [@Meyer1983]. For example, wildfire combined with post-fire salvage logging in the slopes of Alberta's southern Rockies resulted in higher turbidity and DOC compared to basins that experienced fire without salvage logging, and both disturbed basins had elevated suspended solids and DOC compared to un-burned catchments [@Emelko2011; *more refs*]. In other studies, it was shown that two to three years post-harvest, baseflow DOC concentrations were higher in forested catchments than in clear-cut catchments; however, these studies also showed variable stormflow DOC responses in harvested and forested catchments [@Meyer1983; @Mistick2019]. In the absence of long-term baseline data (i.e. pre- and post-disturbance data sets), the natural variability in fluvial processes complicates land-use studies and anthropogenic climate change can further confound our interpretations. Overall, NOM relationships to land-use are highly dependent on catchment attributes and hydrology. Understanding the hydrochemistry of a water supply area is key to conducting informed preventative forest management applications.

\  

It's possible that changing climatic conditions could lead to increases in hydrologic pulse generation through increased precipitation, earlier or more intense freshet conditions, or changes in subsurface flow and connectivity. Thus, drinking water treatment challenges could arise in response to more variable source water conditions. For forested source water supply areas, developing a better understanding of hydrochemical dynamics and their responses to landscape changes (e.g. wildfire, forest management strategies, mass wasting events) could bolster drinking water security by developing source water protection plans to facilitate more predictable treatment requirements. Understanding water supply area source water quality, variability and response patterns is an important part of the multi-barrier approach to safe drinking water [@CCME2004]. 

\  

### Surface water sampling strategies

A discrete water sample cannot tell a complete story of a hydrologic system's water quality dynamics but it can provide information about specific attributes of the water in a given place at a certain time -- so long as that sample accurately represent the body from which it was collected. Non-representative sampling techniques will lead to non-representative analytical results and ultimately to erroneous conclusions [@CCME2011]. Collection of water samples must be done consistently and carefully to avoid sample contamination or sampling errors which would generate unreliable analytical results [@CCME2011]. In a carbon-based world, sample contamination must be a crucial and constant consideration when sampling for NOM [@CCME2011; @Cory2011]. 

\  

The basis of a water quality monitoring network is the collection of representative quantitative data for physical, chemical or biological parameters that help to characterize a hydrologic system over time [@Strobl2008a]. A monitoring network, therefore, will involve some form of a sampling program and it's design should reflect research objectives and account for physical realities (e.g. spatiotemporal heterogeneity), while being cost-effective and practical [@Strobl2008a; @Kirchner2006]. Grab-sampling is a standard method of collecting whole-water samples for laboratory or stream-side analysis [@CCME2011; @Ruhala2017]. Synoptic grab sampling can be completed at a number of sites over a relatively short period of time (e.g. hours to days) to assess spatial variations, however there is often a lack of temporal resolution due to scheduled, convenient or opportunistic sampling at relatively low frequencies [@Ruhala2017]. 

\  

High flows present an opportunity to capture dynamic water quality changes that occur during events; however, it can be difficult to schedule a synoptic sampling campaign for specific weather and flow conditions, especially for short duration of rapid runoff (@Harmel2003). Furthermore, it is logistically challenging and potentially dangerous to manually collect grab samples during events across multiple sites (@Graczyk2000; @Mackay2012). Rather than manual collection, pump samplers or passive siphon samplers can be used to collect water samples under difficult or unsafe conditions. 

\  

A pump sampler (e.g. ISCO samplers, Teledyne ISCO, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA; or Global Water Instrumentation, Gold River, California) can be set up in the field and programmed to collect a set of water samples based on time intervals or changes in conditions (e.g. stage or turbidity thresholds). Pump samplers are effective for automatic event-based sampling (@Harmel2003) but can be prohibitively expensive ($2K-3K CAD), and also require a reliable power source which can pose logistical challenged for setting up at multiple sites in remote or difficult to access locations (@Mackay2012). A passive siphon sampler is an alternative to a pump sampler that automatically and effectively collects discrete water samples on the rising limb of the hydrograph (e.g.: @Mackay2012; @Graczyk2000; @Diehl2007). Siphon samplers are limited to sampling a single event and (so far) are not suitable for sampling the falling hydrograph limb; they are however very low cost, customizable and require no power [@Newham2001].

\  

Given that brief flood events are often responsible for most of the DOC transport in a river system [@Raymond2016], event-based water sampling is an important part of a water quality monitoring program. The rising limb of the hydrograph has been shown to have higher DOC concentration than low flows between storm pulses [@Yang2015; @Raymond2016; @Raymond2010; @Zarnetske2018]. The change in DOC concentration across the rising limb is indicative of source pools of NOM, where increasing rising limb DOC indicates that source material is unlimited and flux is driven by hydrologic connectivity; whereas NOM is likely source-limited if DOC concentration decreases on the rising limb [@Zarnetske2018]. Therefore, the collection of event-based river samples is important for clarifying the magnitude and direction of water quality changes in response to precipitation, and providing information about solute supply and hydrologic connectivity to the landscape [@Vidon2008; @Abbott2018; @Creed2015; @Zarnetske2018].

\  

###    Source water considerations for Greater Victoria's water supply areas

The Capital Regional District (CRD) encompasses the southern tip of Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada) including Victoria and the southern Gulf Islands. As drinking water providers, the CRD is committed to the multiple barrier approach to clean drinking water and has taken control of source water protection by purchasing and managing the water supply areas for Greater Victoria. Located on southeastern Vancouver Island, the Greater Victoria Water Supply Area (GVWSA) includes 205.49 km^2^ of protected drinking water catchment lands. Currently, Greater Victoria's water supply is sourced from five surface water reservoirs in the Sooke and Goldstream watersheds; Sooke Reservoir is the primary drinking water supply. Treatment of source water from the GVWSA consists only of disinfection: raw water (unfiltered) is treated with ultraviolet light as primary disinfection, chlorination is secondary, and finally ammonia is added to produce chloramine (NH~2~Cl), a long-lasting disinfectant that persists throughout the distribution system [@CRD]. 

\  

In anticipation of future water demands and uncertainty related to rainfall and climate change, the CRD purchased an additional 96.28 km^2^ of land in 2007 and 2010. This area includes about 92% of the Leech River watershed (~95 km^2^) which was designated as the Leech Water Supply Area (Leech WSA) for future supplemental source water. In the future, possibly by 2050, inter-basin transfer will move water from the Leech WSA through a diversion tunnel to supplement Sooke Reservoir (Figure \@ref(fig:GVWSAoverview)).  

\  

```{r GVWSAoverview, out.width = "50%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "Overview of the Leech and Sooke Water Supply Areas (Capital Regional District, Greater Victoria), located on southeastern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.

knitr::include_graphics("R-inputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/images/thesis-map_inset-overview_colour.png")
```

\  

Prior to purchase by the CRD, the Leech WSA was privately managed forest land (commercial sustained harvest) which was extensively harvested (nearly 96% clearcut over the past 70 years); as a result, a large portion of the Leech WSA is densely forested with softwood stands around 50 years of age (as of 2020). The second growth forests of the Leech WSA are no longer managed for timber supply, but rather to improve and maintain drinking source water quality and to reduce the risk of landscape level wildfire. Due to prior harvest, reforestation and active fire suppression, forest fire fuels have accumulated in the Leech and pose a threat if a fire occurs. In the Sooke WSA, the CRD implements forest treatments designed to foster healthy forest stands capable of reducing fire intensity, such as reducing fuel hazards and creating conditions that are safe for crews to action a fire (e.g. closed-canopy fuel breaks). Similar preventative fire treatments may be applied in the LWSA prior to inter-basin transfers. 

\  

Before work is done on inter-basin transfers, the Leech River system needs to be better understood. Hydrology and water quality monitoring programs for the Leech WSA began in 2017, thus there is currently little historical data to describe hydrochemical dynamics across the watershed. Further understanding the Leech WSA will help to inform forest management strategies and allow for the effects of fire fuel management on water supply to be better evaluated. Furthermore, describing relationships of event-based water quality dynamics across the Leech WSA will help to anticipate possible treatment challenges that could occur with future inter-basin transfers an mixing between the Leech and Sooke WSAs. Understanding source water quality in relation to hydrology is an essential component to multiple barrier approach to ensuring clean drinking water. 

\  

###   Research questions and objectives

This research was conducted in partnership with the CRD and forWater Network to better understand variations in source water quality across second-growth forested watersheds, primarily with respect to DOC and NOM dynamics. This thesis tackled three research questions (RQ) and associated objectives.

\  

__Research Question 1.__   How does NOM concentration and character vary among adjacent drainage basins and across nested sub-catchments in the Greater Victoria Water Supply Area, and what influence does seasonality have?

__Objective 1:__   Design a sampling strategy to describe spatial and temporal patterns and variation of NOM concentrations and character.

\  

__Research Question 2.__   What are the primary drivers (e.g. watershed characteristics or conditions) for changes in NOM concentrations and character in the Leech watershed?

__Objective 2:__   Relate water sample results to watershed characteristics and conditions to report on relationships between NOM and possible explanatory variables.

\  

__Research Question 3.__   What are the implications for watershed management and future drinking water supply?

__Objective 3:__   Provide context of how results can be used to inform watershed management planning for wildfire reduction strategies and design of continued water quality monitoring for future inter-basin transfers.

\  

Results of this research will contribute to baseline understanding and could be applied in further exploration of forest management strategies, such as fire fuel management, and their impacts on source water quality and supply.

#### Thesis structure outline

Chapter 2 outlines common methods that were used to generate results discussed in later chapters; it introduces details of the study site, and explains methods used for surface water sampling, laboratory analyses and data handling. Chapter 2 also includes foundational results upon which all subsequent data analysis relied. Chapters 3 and 4 present research findings from two different perspectives. Chapter 3 interprets synoptic sampling results to elucidate broad spatial and temporal patterns in NOM concentrations and character across twelve sites in the GVWSA, and assesses the sampling program design. Chapter 4 focuses on six monitoring sites in the Leech WSA to evaluate research findings in context of watershed drivers for DOC and NOM dynamics. A comprehensive summary and discussion follows.
