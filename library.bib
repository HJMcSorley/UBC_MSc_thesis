abstract = {Snowmelt-runoff processes on frozen ground are poorly understood at the hillslope scale. This is especially true for hillslopes on the northern Great Plains of North America where long periods of snow-covered frozen ground with very shallow slopes mask any spatial patterns and process controls on connectivity and hillslope runoff generation. This study examines a 4.66 ha (46,600 m2) hillslope on the northern Great Plains during the 2014 spring snowmelt season to explore hillslope runoff processes. Specifically, we explore the spatial patterns of runoff production source areas and examine how surface topography and patterns of snow cover, snow water equivalent, soil water content, and thawed layer depth – which we measured on a 10 m grid across our 46,600 m2 hillslope – affect melt water partitioning and runoff connectivity. A key question was whether or not the controls on connectivity are consistent with the fill and spill mechanism found in rain-dominated and unfrozen soil domains. The contrast between the slow infiltration rates into frozen soil and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt delivery to the soil surface resulted in water accumulation in small depressions under the snowpack. Consequently, infiltration was minimal over the 12 day melt period. Instead, nested filling of micro- and meso-depressions was followed by macro-scale, whole-slope spilling. This spilling occurred when large patches of ponded water exceeded the storage capacity behind downslope micro barriers in the surface topography, and flows from them coalesced to drive a rapid increase in runoff at the hillslope outlet. These observations of ponded water and flowpaths followed mapable fill and spill locations based on 2 m resolution digital topographic analysis. Interestingly, while surface topography is relatively unimportant under unfrozen conditions at our site because of low relief and high infiltrability, surface topography shows episodically critical importance for connectivity and runoff generation when the ground is frozen.},

abstract = {Online monitoring dissolved organic matter (DOM) is urgent for water treatment management. In this study, high performance size exclusion chromatography with multi-UV absorbance and multi-emission fluorescence scans were applied to spectrally characterize samples from 16 drinking water sources across Yangzi River and Huai River Watersheds. The UV absorbance indices at 254 nm and 280 nm referred to the same DOM components and concentration, and the 280 nm UV light could excite both protein-like and humic-like fluorescence. Hence a novel UV fluorescence sensor was developed out using only one UV280 light-emitting diode (LED) as light source. For all samples, enhanced coagulation was mainly effective for large molecular weight biopolymers; while anion exchange further substantially removed humic substances. During chlorination tests, UVA280 and UVA254 showed similar correlations with yields of disinfection byproducts (DBPs); the humic-like fluorescence obtained from LED sensors correlated well with both trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids yields, while the correlation between protein-like fluorescence and trihalomethanes was relatively poor. Anion exchange exhibited more reduction of DBPs yields as well as UV absorbance and fluorescence signals than enhanced coagulation. The results suggest that the LED UV fluorescence sensors are very promising for online monitoring DOM and predicting DBPs formation potential during water treatment.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first of two physically-based modifications to a widely-used and well-validated hydrologic precipitation–runoff model. Here, we modify the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model to include a physically-based representation of the effects of freezing and thawing soil on the runoff generation process. This model is called the SAC-SMA Heat Transfer model (SAC-HT). The frozen ground physics are taken from the Noah land surface model which serves as the land surface component of several National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) numerical weather prediction models. SAC-HT requires a boundary condition of the soil temperature at the bottom of the soil column (a climatic annual air temperature is typically used, and parameters derived from readily available soil texture data). A noteworthy feature of SAC-HT is that the frozen ground component needs no parameter calibration. SAC-HT was tested at 11 sites in the U.S. for soil temperature, one site in Russia for soil temperature and soil moisture, eight basins in the upper Midwest for the effects of frozen-ground on streamflow, and one location for frost depth. High correlation coefficients for simulated soil temperature at three depths at 11 stations were achieved. Multi-year simulations of soil moisture and soil temperature agreed very well at the Valdai, Russia test location. In eight basins affected by seasonally frozen soil in the upper Midwest, SAC-HT provided improved streamflow simulations compared to SAC-SMA when both models used a priori parameters. Further improvement was gained through calibration of the non-frozen ground a priori parameters. Frost depth computed by SAC-HT compared well with observed values in the Root River basin in Minnesota.},

abstract = {As a result of global warming, the discharges from rivers in permafrost regions have varied significantly. However, its mechanism remains unclear. One of possible factors is active soil freeze-thaw cycle, which may influence surface runoff in the variation of permafrost water cycle processes. In this study, a typical permafrost watershed in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau was selected, its hydrological processes were monitored from 2004 to 2007, and the effects of the freezing and thawing depth of the soil active layer on runoff processes were assessed. The runoff modulus, runoff coefficient, direct runoff ratio, recession gradient and their seasonal variations were estimated and analyzed. The active soil dynamics and water budget were analyzed to prove the features of the surface runoff and the influences of active soil freeze-thaw processes. The primary factors influencing surface runoff processes during different seasons were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and statistical regression methods. The results showed that the high runoff coefficient and low direct runoff ratio were the main characteristics during the spring flood period (May-June) and during the autumn recession period (September). The runoff modulus and its year-to-year variability were the greatest in the summer flood period. The direct runoff ratio decreased from 0.43 in May to 0.29 in September, with the exception of the highest ratio, which occurred during the summer recession period (July). The active soil thawing in the upper layer of depth of 60 cm had contributed to increase in discharge, but the increase in thawing depth deeper than 60 cm led to a decrease in surface runoff and slowness in the recession process. Precipitation played a small role in the spring flood runoff and the autumn runoff. The soil active layer freeze-thaw variation, which affected seasonal soil water dynamic and water budget and reformed seasonal runoff characteristics, along with vegetation cover changes, is considered the potential major factor in control of the hydrological processes in the permafrost region. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The solution chemistry of forested streams primarily in western North America is explained by considering the major factors that influence this chemistry — geological weathering; atmospheric precipitation and climate; precipitation acidity; terrestrial biological processes; physical/chemical reactions in the soil; and physical, chemical, and biological processes within streams. Due to the complexity of all these processes and their varying importance for different chemicals, stream water chemistry has exhibited considerable geographic and temporal variation and is difficult to model accurately. The impacts of forest harvesting on stream water chemistry were reviewed by considering the effects of harvesting on each of the important factors controlling this chemistry, as well as other factors influencing these impacts - extent of the watershed harvested, presence of buffer strips between streams and harvested areas, nature of post-harvesting site preparation, revegetation rate following harvesting, pre-harvesting soil fertility, and soil buffering capacity. These effects have sometimes reinforced one another but have sometimes been counterbalancing or slight so that harvesting impacts on stream water chemistry have been highly variable. Eight major knowledge gaps were identified, two of which — a scarcity of detailed stream chemical budgets and knowledge of longitudinal variation in stream chemistry — relate to undisturbed streams, while the remainder relate to forest harvesting effects.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The perhumid region of the coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) of Pacific North America is one of the wettest places on Earth and contains numerous small catchments that discharge freshwater and high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) directly to the coastal ocean. However, empirical data on the flux and composition of DOC exported from these watersheds are scarce. We established monitoring stations at the outlets of seven catchments on Calvert and Hecate islands, British Columbia, which represent the rain-dominated hypermaritime region of the perhumid CTR. Over several years, we measured stream discharge, stream water DOC concentration, and stream water dissolved organic-matter (DOM) composition. Discharge and DOC concentrations were used to calculate DOC fluxes and yields, and DOM composition was characterized using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The areal estimate of annual DOC yield in water year 2015 was 33.3 Mg C km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, with individual watersheds ranging from an average of 24.1 to 37.7 Mg C km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. This represents some of the highest DOC yields to be measured at the coastal margin. We observed seasonality in the quantity and composition of exports, with the majority of DOC export occurring during the extended wet period (September–April). Stream flow from catchments reacted quickly to rain inputs, resulting in rapid export of relatively fresh, highly terrestrial-like DOM. DOC concentration and measures of DOM composition were related to stream discharge and stream temperature and correlated with watershed attributes, including the extent of lakes and wetlands, and the thickness of organic and mineral soil horizons. Our discovery of high DOC yields from these small catchments in the CTR is especially compelling as they deliver relatively fresh, highly terrestrial organic matter directly to the coastal ocean. Hypermaritime landscapes are common on the British Columbia coast, suggesting that this coastal margin may play an important role in the regional processing of carbon and in linking terrestrial carbon to marine ecosystems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are gaining traction as they offer mineralization potential rather than transferring contaminants between media. However, AOPs operated with limited energy and/or chemical inputs can exacerbate disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation, even as precursors such as dissolved organic carbon, UV254, and specific UV absorbance (SUVA) decrease. This study examined the relationship between DBP precursors and formation using TiO2 photocatalysis experiments, external AOP and non-AOP data, and predictive DBP models. The top-performing indicator, SUVA, generally correlated positively with trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, but limited-energy photocatalysis yielded contrasting negative correlations. The accuracy of predicted DBP values from models based on bulk parameters was generally poor, regardless of use and extent of AOP treatment and type of source water. Though performance improved for scenarios bounded by conditions used in model development, only 0.5{\%} of the model/dataset pairings satisfied all measured parameter boundary conditions, thereby introducing skepticism toward model usefulness. Study findings suggest that caution should be employed when using bulk indicators and/or models as a metric for AOP mitigation of DBP formation potential, particularly for limited-energy/chemical inputs.},

abstract = {Despite an increasing recognition of the importance of extreme rainfall events for organic carbon export to inland waters, little attention has been paid to the export and reactivity of particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) in mountainous headwater watersheds under monsoon climates. To investigate environmental implications of storm-enhanced export of POC and DOC in mountainous headwater streams, we examined the relationships between storm magnitude and C export from a forested watershed in the Haean Basin, South Korea, during 13 storm events over 4 years and compared potentials of DOC and POC for biodegradation and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation during an extreme rainfall event with a total rainfall of 209 mm. Event mean concentrations and export of POC increased nonlinearly above thresholds of precipitation and discharge, far exceeding the relatively small increases of DOC. The export of POC during a few storm events with a total rainfall above 200 mm per event exceeded the annual organic C export during dry years. During the 209 mm storm event, concentrations of total trihalomethanes formed by POC-derived dissolved components changed synchronously with POC concentrations, exhibiting lower levels than those formed by DOC. During a 30-day incubation at 25 degrees C, DOC exported during peak flow exhibited rapid biodegradation of labile components within 7 days. In contrast, the concentrations of DOC leached from POC gradually increased following the initial decline. Gradual transformation of POC-derived dissolved materials resulted in greater increases in the intensity of fulvic-and humic-like fluorescent components compared to the DOC treatment. The results highlight the significance of extreme rainfall events as "hot moments" for POC export from mountainous watersheds and also suggest that storm pulses of POC can provide potential sources of reactive organic components that can rapidly biodegrade and form DBPs after being released into headwater streams.},

abstract = {Dynamics of river dissolved organic matter (DOM) during storm events have profound influences on the downstream aquatic ecosystem and drinking water safety. This study investigated temporal variations in DOM during four storm events in two forest headwater streams (the EH and JH brooks, South Korea) and the impacts on the disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formation potential. The within-event variations of most DOM quantity parameters were similar to the flow rate in the EH but not in the larger JH brook. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis with the flow rate in the EH and JH brooks, respectively, indicating the importance of both flow path and DOM source pool size in determining the effects of storm events. The stream DOM became less aromatic/humified from the first to the last event in both brooks, probably due to the increasing fresh plant pool and the decreasing leaf litter pool during the course of rainy season. The DOC export during each event increased 1.3-2.7- and 1.1-7.0-fold by stormflows in the EH and JH brooks, respectively. The leaf litter and soil together was the major DOM source, particularly during early events. The enhanced DOM export probably increases the risks of DBPs formation in disinfection, as indicated by a strong correlation observed between DOC and trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP). High correlations between two humic-like fluorescent components and THMFP further suggested the potential of assessing THMFP with in situ fluorescence sensors during storms.},

abstract = {Hydrologic processes of glacier, snow, frozen soil, groundwater, surface water and precipitation have always been the common concern of hydrologists. The purpose of this study is to identify the hydrologic processes in different landscape zones, based on the isotopic and hydrochemical analysis of glacier, snow, frozen soil and groundwater. The chemical compositions were characterized by Ca–HCO3 in the glacier snow zone, Mg–Ca–SO4–HCO3 in the alpine cold desert zone, Ca–Mg–HCO3 in the marsh meadow zone, Ca–Mg–HCO3 in the alpine shrub zone, and Na–Ca–SO4 in the mountain grassland zone. The end-member mixing model was employed for hydrograph separation. The results showed that during the melting period Mafengou River water was recharged by glacier–snow melt water about 34{\%}, thawed frozen soil water in each of the landscape zones about 12{\%}, and groundwater about 54{\%}. This study suggested that Mafengou River water during the melting period was mainly recharged by glacier–snow melt water, groundwater and thawed frozen soil water.},

abstract = {Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is a cornerstone therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). With increasing numbers of PVI procedures, demand arises to reduce the cumulative fluoroscopic radiation exposure for both the physician and the patient. New technologies are emerging to address this issue. Here, we report our first experiences with a new fluoroscopy integrating technology in addition to a current 3D-mapping system. The new fluoroscopy integrating system (FIS) with 3D-mapping was used prospectively in 15 patients with AF. Control PVI cases (n = 37) were collected retrospectively as a complete series. Total procedure time (skin to skin), fluoroscopic time, and dose-area-product (DAP) data were analyzed. All PVI procedures were performed by one experienced physician using a commercially available circular multipolar irrigated ablation catheter. All PVI procedures were successfully undertaken without major complications. Baseline characteristics of the two groups showed no significant differences. In the group using the FIS, the fluoroscopic time and DAP were significantly reduced from 571 +/- 187 seconds versus 1011 +/- 527 seconds (P = 0.0029) and 4342 +/- 2073 cGycm(2) versus 6208 +/- 3314 cGycm(2) (P = 0.049), respectively. Mean procedure time was not significantly affected and was 114 +/- 31 minutes versus 104 +/- 24 minutes (P = 0.23) by the FIS.The use of the new FIS with the current 3D-mapping system enables a significant reduction of the total fluoroscopy time and DAP compared to the previous combination of 3D-mapping system plus normal fluoroscopy during PVI utilizing a circular multipolar irrigated ablation catheter. However, the concomitant total procedure time is not affected. Thus, the new system reduces the radiation exposure for both the physicians and patients.},

abstract = {Fluoroscopy, or real-time projection X-ray imaging, has been in clinical use since shortly after Roentgen's discovery of X-rays. Early fluoroscopes consisted simply of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which the patient was placed. After passing through the patient, the remnant beam impinged upon the fluorescent screen and produced a visible glow, which was directly observed by the practitioner. In modern systems, the fluorescent screen is coupled to an electronic device that amplifies and transforms the glowing light into a video signal suitable for presentation on an electronic display. One benefit of the modern system compared to the earlier approach is that the fluoroscopist need not stand in close proximity to the fluorescent screen in order to observe the live image. This results in a substantial reduction in radiation dose to the fluoroscopist. Patients receive less radiation dose as well, because of the amplification and overall efficiency of the imaging system. Fluoroscopy differs from most other X-ray imaging in that the images produced appear in real-time, allowing evaluation of dynamic biological processes and guiding interventions. Electronic fluoroscopy systems create this perception by capturing and displaying images at a high frame rate, typically 25 or 30 frames per second. At these frame rates, the human visual system cannot distinguish frame-to-frame variation and motion appears to be continuous, without visible flicker. To achieve high frame rates while keeping cumulative radiation dose to a reasonable level, the radiation dose to the image receptor per image (i.e., per frame) must be kept quite low, about 0.1{\%} of the dose used in radiography. Fluoroscopic images appear with an inverted grayscale (black/white is reversed) compared with standard radiographs. This convention is derivative of the appearance of the early non-intensified fluoroscopic screens, and it has been retained in the digital age even though the capability now exists to digitally reverse the grayscale.},

abstract = {Predicting sediment production from forest roads is necessary to determine their impact on watersheds and associated terrestrial and stream biota. A method is presented for measuring sediment originating from a road segment for individual storm events and quantifying the delivery to streams. Site selection criteria are listed to describe the characteristics for efficient data collection and analysis. The method describes equipment used to quantify sediment transport—data loggers, a rain gage, a traffic counter, Parshall flumes with stilling wells, hydrostatic pressure transducers, and water pumping samplers—as well as variables associated with sediment production—road surfacing material, traffic intensity, gradient, age, construction method, and precipitation. A sampling protocol that worked well for the forest roads in southeast Alaska and can be adapted for use in other regions also is described. Examples of data collection and analysis are explained both for sites near the road and downstream sites for sediment delivery quantification. This method can be used to determine the downstream transport of sediment originating from roads and developing regression models or validating existing sediment models.},

abstract = {In this study, the disinfection byproduct formation potential (DBPFP) of three surface waters with the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content of 2.5, 5.2, and 7.9. mg/L was investigated. The formation and distribution of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were evaluated. Samples collected from three surface waters in China were fractionated based on molecular weight and hydrophobicity. The raw water containing more hydrophobic (Ho) fraction exhibited higher formation potentials of haloacetic acid and trihalomethane. The DBPFP of the surface waters did not correlate with the DOC value. The values of DBPFP per DOC were correlated with the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) for Ho and Hi fractions. The obtained results suggested that SUVA cannot reveal the ability of reactive sites to form disinfection byproducts for waters with few aromatic structures. Combined with the analysis of FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the raw waters and the corresponding fractions, it was concluded that the Ho fraction with phenolic hydroxyl and conjugated double bonds was responsible for the production of trichloromethanes and trichloroacetic acids. The Hi fraction with amino and carboxyl groups had the potential to form dichloroacetic acids and chlorinated trihalomethanes. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

Results showed that the surface soil intercepted 94.4 ± 1.2 {\%} of the annual litter leachate DOC flux and is a sink for DOC. The throughfall and litter leachate DOC fluxes amounted to 6.81 and 7.23 {\%} of the net ecosystem exchange respectively, indicating that the DOC flux through hydrological processes is an important component of the carbon budget, and may be an important link between hydrological processes and soil respiration in a tropical rainforest. Even the variability in soil respiration is more dependent on the hydrologically transported water than DOC flux insignificantly, soil temperature, and soil-water content (at 0–20 cm). The difference in $\delta$13C between the soil, soil water (at 0–20 cm), throughfall, and litter leachate indicated that DOC is transformed in the surface soil and decreased the sensitivity indices of soil respiration of DOC flux to water flux, which suggests that soil respiration is more sensitive to the DOC flux in hydrological processes, especially the soil-water DOC flux, than to soil temperature or soil moisture.},

A critical question for understanding contemporary and future responses to environmental change is how the spatio-temporal dynamics of runoff generation processes will be affected. We sampled stable water isotopes in soils, lakes and rivers on an unprecedented spatio-temporal scale along a 1700 km transect over three years in the Western Siberia Lowlands. Our findings suggest that snowmelt mixes with, and displaces, large volumes of water stored in the organic soils and lakes to generate runoff during the thaw season. Furthermore, we saw a persistent hydrological connection between water bodies and the landscape across permafrost regions. Our findings help to bridge the understanding between small and large scale hydrological studies in high-latitude systems. These isotope data provide a means to conceptualise hydrological connectivity in permafrost and wetland influenced regions, which is needed for an improved understanding of future biogeochemical changes.},

abstract = {The solution chemistry of forested streams primarily in western North America is explained by considering the major factors that influence this chemistry-geological weathering; atmospheric precipitation and climate; precipitation acidity; terrestrial biological processes; physical/chemical reactions in the soil; and physical, chemical, and biological processes within streams. Due to the complexity of all these processes and their varying importance for different chemicals, stream water chemistry has exhibited considerable geographic and temporal variation and is difficult to model accurately. The impacts of forest harvesting on stream water chemistry were reviewed by considering the effects of harvesting on each of the important factors controlling this chemistry, as well as other factors influencing these impacts - extent of the watershed harvested, presence of buffer strips between streams and harvested areas, nature of post-harvesting site preparation, revegetation rate following harvesting, pre-harvesting soil fertility, and soil buffering capacity. These effects have sometimes reinforced one another but have sometimes been counterbalancing or slight so that harvesting impacts on stream water chemistry have been highly variable. Eight major knowledge gaps were identified, two of which - a scarcity of detailed stream chemical budgets and knowledge of longitudinal variation in stream chemistry - relate to undisturbed streams, while the remainder relate to forest harvesting effects.},

This study compares the influence of land use and climate on DBP precursors in two catchments supplying the region around the City of Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada, and assesses the variability of Disinfection By-Product (DBP) concentration and speciation following rainfall events. DBPs (trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs)) and their precursors in raw waters (pH, turbidity, specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), total and dissolved organic carbon, bromides and chlorine dose) were monitored. Various experimental chlorination tests, DBP formation potential (DBPFP) and Simulated Distribution Systems (SDS), were also performed. Differences in pre-rainfall (baseflow) water quality were noted according to the different watershed land uses. Raw water quality patterns showed modifications between baseflow and rainfall periods, with a degradation of raw water quality according to turbidity and SUVA in both water sources. Rainfall events were also shown to alter organic matter reactivity with an increase in THM formation potential for both sites. A less noticeable impact on HAA formation potential was observed. However, no clear differences in DBPFP tests were observed between the sites. SDS tests showed that rainfall events lead to considerable rises in organic carbon reactivity of filtered waters, even after primary treatment, with a 2-fold increase in THM and HAA concentrations following rainfall for waters representing the end of one main distribution system (20 h contact time). These increases are linked mainly to a rise in non-brominated DBPs such as chloroform, trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid. This study confirms the importance of strictly controlling OM levels during drinking water treatment to ensure safe drinking water quality throughout the distribution system.},

While multimetric indices have been used to show community composition, pollution tolerance, species diversity, and trophic structure with a combined index, the specific environmental factors that drive biological communities may be better explained through the use of multivariate statistical techniques. Macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages were sampled along with water quality, landuse and qualitative and quantitative habitat assessments from forty-nine sites throughout the Choctawhatchee-Pea, a southeastern U.S. watershed. Multivariate statistical analyses of habitat, water quality, and land-use data were used to determine the relationship between environmental variables and the dependent biological variables, macroinvertebrate and fish community structure. Sampling of biological and environmental data showed that there was a great deal of homogeneity within the watershed, which complicated the task of identifying environmental influences on biological assemblages. Macro-invertebrate and fish assemblages of the Choctawhatchee-Pea watershed were similar in their response to environmental conditions with water chemistry having the greatest relationship to macro-invertebrate and fish community structure followed by instream habitat and land use.

abstract = {While much of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within rivers is destined for mineralization to CO2, a substantial fraction of riverine bicarbonate (HCO3−) flux represents a CO2 sink, as a result of weathering processes that sequester CO2 as HCO3−. We explored landscape-level controls on DOC and HCO3− flux in subcatchments of the boreal, with a specific focus on the effect of permafrost on riverine dissolved C flux. To do this, we undertook a multivariate analysis that partitioned the variance attributable to known, key regulators of dissolved C flux (runoff, lithology, and vegetation) prior to examining the effect of permafrost, using riverine biogeochemistry data from a suite of subcatchments drawn from the Mackenzie, Yukon, East, and West Siberian regions of the circumboreal. Across the diverse catchments that we study, controls on HCO3−flux were near-universal: runoff and an increased carbonate rock contribution to weathering (assessed as riverwater Ca:Na) increased HCO3− yields, while increasing permafrost extent was associated with decreases in HCO3−. In contrast, permafrost had contrasting and region-specific effects on DOC yield, even after the variation caused by other key drivers of its flux had been accounted for. We used ionic ratios and SO4 yields to calculate the potential range of CO2sequestered via weathering across these boreal subcatchments, and show that decreasing permafrost extent is associated with increases in weathering-mediated CO2 fixation across broad spatial scales, an effect that could counterbalance some of the organic C mineralization that is predicted with declining permafrost.},

abstract = {Drinking water purveyors are increasingly relying on land conservation and management to ensure the safety of the water that they provide to consumers. To cost-effectively implement any such landscape initiatives, resources must be targeted to the appropriate spatial scale to address quality impairments of concern in a cost-effective manner. Using data gathered from 40 Canadian rivers across four ecozones, we examined the spatial scales at which land use was most closely associated with drinking source water quality metrics. Exploratory linear mixed-effects models accounting for climatic, hydrological, and physiographic variation among sites suggested that different spatial areas of land-use influence drinking source water quality depending on the parameter and season investigated. Escherichia coli spatial variability was only associated with land use at a local (5-10 km) spatial scale. Turbidity measures exhibited a complex association with land use, suggesting that the land-use areas of greatest influence can range from a 1 km subcatchment to the entire watershed depending on the season. Total organic carbon concentrations were only associated with land use characterized at the entire watershed scale. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index was used to calculate a composite measure of seasonal drinking source water quality but did not provide additional information beyond the analyses of individual parameters. These results suggest that entire watershed management is required to safeguard drinking water sources with more focused efforts at targeted spatial scales to reduce specific risk parameters.

abstract = {Understanding of the processes that control CO2 concentrations in the aquatic environment has been hampered by the absence of a direct method to make continuous measurements over both short- and long-term time intervals. We describe an in situ method in which a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor is enclosed in a water impermeable, gas permeable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane and deployed in a freshwater environment. This allows measurements of CO2 concentration to be made directly at a specific depth in the water column without the need for pumps or reagents. We demonstrate the potential of the method using examples from different aquatic environments characterized by a range of CO2 concentrations (0.5–8.0 mg CO2-C L-1, equivalent to ca 40–650 $\mu$mol CO2 L-1). These comprise streams and ponds from tropical, temperate and boreal regions. Data derived from the sensor was compared with direct measurements of CO2 concentrations using headspace analysis. Sensor performance following long-term ({\textgreater}6 months) field deployment conformed to manufacturers' specifications, with no drift detected. We conclude that the sensor-based method is a robust, accurate and responsive method, with a wide range of potential applications, particularly when combined with other in situ sensor-based measurements of related variables.},

abstract = {1. Landscape characteristics of sixty-two subcatchments within the Saginaw Bay Catchment of central Michigan were examined to identify relationships with stream water chemistry. Land use, land cover and elevation were quantified for both entire catchments and the upland-river ecotone (100 m stream buffer strip). Catchment and ecotone data were then empirically compared with stream water chemistry using multivariate and regression analyses. Redundancy analysis was used to partition variance among land use, geology, and the shared influence of land use and geology. 2. Major catchments dominated by rowcrop agriculture had the highest alkalinity, total dissolved solids and nitrate + nitrite concentrations. 3. Strong seasonal differences were observed in total nitrogen and nitrite + nitrate, but not in total phosphorus or suspended solids. Land use and landscape structure factors such as slope and patch density (number of land use patches per km2) accounted for most of the observed variance in summer. 4. In both autumn and summer, landscape factors accounted for much of the observed variation in total dissolved solids and alkalinity. During autumn, geological factors and the shared influence of geology/landscape structure plus land use exerted more influence than did land use alone. 5. Total phosphorus and total suspended solids were much better explained by land use within the stream ecotone in summer than in other seasons. However, total nitrogen, nitrate, orthophosphate and alkalinity were equally well explained by land use within the ecotone and throughout the whole catchment. Only total dissolved solids in summer and ammonium in autumn were explained better by the whole catchment than the ecotone. 6. Our results show that relatively coarse spatial databases can provide useful descriptors of regional water quality.},

abstract = {There is a lack of knowledge about how to quantify runoff generation and the hydrological processes operating in permafrost catchments on semi-arid plateaus. To understand how freeze-thaw cycles affect runoff generation processes in permafrost catchments, a typical headwater catchment with continuous permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau was measured. A new approach is presented in this study to account for runoff processes on the spring thawing period and autumn freezing period, when runoff generation clearly differs from that of non-permafrost catchments. This approach introduces a soil temperature-based water saturation function and modifies the soil water storage curve with a soil temperature threshold. The results show that surface soil thawing induced saturation excess runoff and subsurface interflow account for approximately 66–86{\%} and 14–34{\%} of total spring runoff, respectively, and the soil temperature significantly affects the runoff generation pattern, the runoff composition and the runoff coefficient with the enlargement of the active layer. The suprapermafrost groundwater discharge decreases exponentially with active layer frozen processes during autumn runoff recession, whereas the ratio of groundwater discharge to total runoff and the direct surface runoff coefficient simultaneously increase. The bidirectional freezing of the active layer controls and changes the autumn runoff processes and runoff composition. The new approach could be used to further develop hydrological models of cold regions dominated by permafrost.},

abstract = {We compared stream ecosystem responses to two types of disturbances: flood and debris flows. A large storm in February 1996 disturbed four similarly sized sub-watersheds of the Calapooia River, in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA. All sub-watersheds had flood and in two, 31 and 81{\%} of the perennial channel, a debris flow affected the channel. For 8 years, we used a suite of approaches: stream temperature, nutrient regime, periphyton and macroinvertebrate assemblages, and resident trout abundance and habitat to evaluate the persistence of instream impacts. Differences in stream temperatures and nitrate- nitrogen concentrations were evident, probably, due to the removal of vegetation and modification of riparian soils at the debris flow sites. Instream biological responses varied. After the event, fish, including trout, were rare with no fish at the debris flow sites. Within 6 years, trout densities (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Oncorhynchus clarki) were similar and young-of-the-year trouts were common. In contrast, periphyton and macroinvertebrate assemblages differed. Periphyton biomass was lower and nitrogen-fixing periphyton was more abundant at the debris flow sites. Macroinvertebrate assemblage diversity was higher at the debris flow sites due to fewer dominant taxa. Macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups also differed with fewer gatherers and more scrapers at the debris flow sites. Debris flow impacts related to loss of riparian canopy will probably persist until mature red alder stands are re-established along stream-reaches affected by debris flows to provide nitrogen input and shade.},

abstract = {Soil respiration, R(S), the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide (CO(2)) from the soil surface to the atmosphere, is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux. However, the dynamics of R(S) are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained. Ecosystem warming experiments, modelling analyses and fundamental biokinetics all suggest that R(S) should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R(S), inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure R(S) on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global R(S) values in the extant four-decade record of R(S) chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide R(S) observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R(S) record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO(2) measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961-1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in R(S). We estimate that the global R(S) in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 +/- 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) between 1989 and 2008, implying a global R(S) response to air temperature (Q(10)) of 1.5. An increasing global R(S) value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.},

abstract = {Hillslope runoff was studied in a subarctic, subalpine environment to improve understanding of runoff generation processes and the mechanisms whereby water moves from hillslopes to the stream. Runoff characteristics of four hillslopes were examined between 1997 and 1999, each with distinct soils, frost, topography and vegetation. Lateral fluxes were confined to hillslopes with porous organic soils overlying less permeable mineral substrates, setting up a two-layer flow system whereby most drainage occurs as quickflow in the porous organic layer as matrix flow and/or as preferential flow in pipes, rills and interconnected surface depressions. During snowmelt, meltwater infiltrated and percolated the porous frozen organic layers with little resistance. Percolation ceased at the organic/mineral interface due to the impermeable nature of frozen mineral soils, forming a perched saturated zone and initiating runoff. Snowmelt runoff was greater on slopes with greater snow water equivalent and reduced organic layer thickness. In summer, runoff was greatest on slopes where wet conditions were sustained by inflow. Stormflow hydrographs responded rapidly to rainfall while exhibiting extended recessions compared with temperate regions. Where sustained inflow occurred, the recession limb showed two segments to reflect different source areas of stormflow production. Recession analysis was used to quantify contributing areas, which were highly variable and controlled largely by hillslope wetness and organic-layer properties. Results indicate that the concept of variable source area for runoff generation applies to subarctic, subalpine catchments.},

The carbon and methane variables were examined for major terrestrial ecosystems (uplands and wetlands) and inland aquatic ecosystems in Alaska in two time periods: baseline (from 1950 through 2009) and future (projections from 2010 through 2099). The assessment used measured and observed data and remote sensing, statistical methods, and simulation models. The national assessment, conducted using the methodology described in SIR 2010-5233, has been completed for the conterminous United States, with results provided in three separate regional reports (PP 1804, PP 1797, and PP 1897).},

abstract = {This work investigated the application of several fluorescence excitation-emission matrix analysis methods as natural organic matter (NOM) indicators for use in predicting the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Waters from four different sources (two rivers and two lakes) were subjected to jar testing followed by 24hr disinfection by-product formation tests using chlorine. NOM was quantified using three common measures: dissolved organic carbon, ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm, and specific ultraviolet absorbance as well as by principal component analysis, peak picking, and parallel factor analysis of fluorescence spectra. Based on multi-linear modeling of THMs and HAAs, principle component (PC) scores resulted in the lowest mean squared prediction error of cross-folded test sets (THMs: 43.7 (??g/L)2, HAAs: 233.3 (??g/L)2). Inclusion of principle components representative of protein-like material significantly decreased prediction error for both THMs and HAAs. Parallel factor analysis did not identify a protein-like component and resulted in prediction errors similar to traditional NOM surrogates as well as fluorescence peak picking. These results support the value of fluorescence excitation-emission matrix-principal component analysis as a suitable NOM indicator in predicting the formation of THMs and HAAs for the water sources studied.},

abstract = {Dynamics of river dissolved organic matter (DOM) during storm events have profound influences on the downstream aquatic ecosystem and drinking water safety. This study investigated temporal variations in DOM during four storm events in two forest headwater streams (the EH and JH brooks, South Korea) and the impacts on the disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formation potential. The within-event variations of most DOM quantity parameters were similar to the flow rate in the EH but not in the larger JH brook. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis with the flow rate in the EH and JH brooks, respectively, indicating the importance of both flow path and DOM source pool size in determining the effects of storm events. The stream DOM became less aromatic/humified from the first to the last event in both brooks, probably due to the increasing fresh plant pool and the decreasing leaf litter pool during the course of rainy season. The DOC export during each event increased 1.3-2.7- and 1.1-7.0-fold by stormflows in the EH and JH brooks, respectively. The leaf litter and soil together was the major DOM source, particularly during early events. The enhanced DOM export probably increases the risks of DBPs formation in disinfection, as indicated by a strong correlation observed between DOC and trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP). High correlations between two humic-like fluorescent components and THMFP further suggested the potential of assessing THMFP with in situ fluorescence sensors during storms.},

abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is being increasingly used to help drinking water utilities meet finished water quality regulations, but its influence on disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors and DBP formation is not completely understood. This study investigated the effect of medium pressure (MP) UV combined with chlorination/chloramination on the fluorescent fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from a United States surface water with median total organic carbon content. Parallel factor analysis was used to understand how UV may alter the capacity of DOM to form DBPs of potential human health concern. The production of chloral hydrate and cyanogen chloride from MP UV followed by chlorine or chloramine, respectively, correlated with a decrease in fluorescence intensity of a protein/tryptophan-like component (R2=0.79-0.99) and a humic-like component (R2=0.91-1.00). This suggests that the UV-induced precursors to these compounds originated from DOM with similar characteristics to these components. The fluorescent DOM components identified in this study are similar to reoccurring components that have been previously identified in a range of raw and treated waters, and this work demonstrates the value of using fluorescence analysis of DOM to understand the relationships between DOM source and DBP formation under a range of treatment conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To better understand the effect of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transported by hydrological processes (rainfall, throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water; 0–20 cm) on soil respiration in tropical rainforests, we detected the DOC flux in rainfall, throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water (0–20 cm), compared the seasonality of $\delta$13CDOC in each hydrological process, and $\delta$13C in leaves, litter, and surface soil, and analysed the throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water (0–20 cm) effect on soil respiration in a tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna, south-west China. Results showed that the surface soil intercepted 94.4 ± 1.2 {\%} of the annual litter leachate DOC flux and is a sink for DOC. The throughfall and litter leachate DOC fluxes amounted to 6.81 and 7.23 {\%} of the net ecosystem exchange respectively, indicating that the DOC flux through hydrological processes is an important component of the carbon budget, and may be an important link between hydrological processes and soil respiration in a tropical rainforest. Even the variability in soil respiration is more dependent on the hydrologically transported water than DOC flux insignificantly, soil temperature, and soil-water content (at 0–20 cm). The difference in $\delta$13C between the soil, soil water (at 0–20 cm), throughfall, and litter leachate indicated that DOC is transformed in the surface soil and decreased the sensitivity indices of soil respiration of DOC flux to water flux, which suggests that soil respiration is more sensitive to the DOC flux in hydrological processes, especially the soil-water DOC flux, than to soil temperature or soil moisture.},

Application of quantile regression revealed a tendency towards downstream spatial and temporal homogenization of DOC concentrations and a shift from dominance of aromatic DOM in headwaters to more aliphatic DOM downstream. The DOC concentration – discharge (C-Q) relationships at each site revealed a downstream tendency towards a slope of zero. We propose that despite complexities in river networks that have driven many revisions to the River Continuum concept, rivers show a tendency towards chemostasis (C-Q slope of zero) because of a ...},

abstract = {Forest fires occur with increasing frequency and severity in the western United States, potentially altering the chemistry and quantity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors exported from forested watersheds. However, little is known concerning effects of the fire triangle (heat, oxygen, and fuel) on DOM alteration. Using detritus from Pinus ponderosa and Abies concolor (dominant species in forests in the western United States), we prepared DOM from unburned and burned detritus under hypoxic (pyrolysis) and oxic conditions (thermal oxidation) at 250 and 400 °C. DOM characteristics and chlorine reactivity were evaluated by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and chlorination-based DBP formation potential tests. Spectroscopic results suggest that burned-detritus extracts had lower molecular weight (reflected by increased E2:E3 and fluorescence index) and divergent aromaticity (reflected by SUVA254) depending on oxygen availability. Temperature and oxygen availabi...},
