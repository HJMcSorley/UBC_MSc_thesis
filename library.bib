abstract = {Increasing concentrations of organic matter (OM) in surface waters have been noted over large parts of the boreal/nemoral zone in Europe and North America. This has raised questions about the causes and the likelihood of further increases. A number of drivers have been proposed, including temperature, hydrology, as well as SO42- and Cl- deposition. The data reported so far, however, have been insufficient to define the relative importance of different drivers in landscapes where they interact. Thirty-five years of monthly measurements of absorbance and chemical oxygen demand (COD), two common proxies for OM, from 28 large Scandinavian catchments provide an unprecedented opportunity to resolve the importance of hypothesized drivers. For 21 of the catchments, there are 18 years of total organic carbon (TOC) measurements as well. Despite the heterogeneity of the catchments with regards to climate, size and land use, there is a high degree of synchronicity in OM across the entire region. Rivers go from widespread trends of decreasing OM to increasing trends and back again three times in the 35-year record. This synchronicity in decadal scale oscillations and long-term trends suggest a common set of dominant OM drivers in these landscapes. Here, we use regression models to test the importance of different potential drivers. We show that flow and SO42- together can predict most of the interannual variability in OM proxies, up to 88{\%} for absorbance, up to 78{\%} for COD. Two other candidate drivers, air temperature and Cl-, add little explanatory value. Declines in anthropogenic SO42- since the mid-1970s are thus related to the observed OM increases in Scandinavia, but, in contrast to many recent studies, flow emerges as an even more important driver of OM variability. Stabilizing SO42- levels also mean that hydrology is likely to be the major driver of future variability and trends in OM. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite an increasing recognition of the importance of extreme rainfall events for organic carbon export to inland waters, little attention has been paid to the export and reactivity of particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) in mountainous headwater watersheds under monsoon climates. To investigate environmental implications of storm-enhanced export of POC and DOC in mountainous headwater streams, we examined the relationships between storm magnitude and C export from a forested watershed in the Haean Basin, South Korea, during 13 storm events over 4 years and compared potentials of DOC and POC for biodegradation and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation during an extreme rainfall event with a total rainfall of 209 mm. Event mean concentrations and export of POC increased nonlinearly above thresholds of precipitation and discharge, far exceeding the relatively small increases of DOC. The export of POC during a few storm events with a total rainfall above 200 mm per event exceeded the annual organic C export during dry years. During the 209 mm storm event, concentrations of total trihalomethanes formed by POC-derived dissolved components changed synchronously with POC concentrations, exhibiting lower levels than those formed by DOC. During a 30-day incubation at 25 degrees C, DOC exported during peak flow exhibited rapid biodegradation of labile components within 7 days. In contrast, the concentrations of DOC leached from POC gradually increased following the initial decline. Gradual transformation of POC-derived dissolved materials resulted in greater increases in the intensity of fulvic-and humic-like fluorescent components compared to the DOC treatment. The results highlight the significance of extreme rainfall events as "hot moments" for POC export from mountainous watersheds and also suggest that storm pulses of POC can provide potential sources of reactive organic components that can rapidly biodegrade and form DBPs after being released into headwater streams.},

abstract = {1. Landscape characteristics of sixty-two subcatchments within the Saginaw Bay Catchment of central Michigan were examined to identify relationships with stream water chemistry. Land use, land cover and elevation were quantified for both entire catchments and the upland-river ecotone (100 m stream buffer strip). Catchment and ecotone data were then empirically compared with stream water chemistry using multivariate and regression analyses. Redundancy analysis was used to partition variance among land use, geology, and the shared influence of land use and geology. 2. Major catchments dominated by rowcrop agriculture had the highest alkalinity, total dissolved solids and nitrate + nitrite concentrations. 3. Strong seasonal differences were observed in total nitrogen and nitrite + nitrate, but not in total phosphorus or suspended solids. Land use and landscape structure factors such as slope and patch density (number of land use patches per km2) accounted for most of the observed variance in summer. 4. In both autumn and summer, landscape factors accounted for much of the observed variation in total dissolved solids and alkalinity. During autumn, geological factors and the shared influence of geology/landscape structure plus land use exerted more influence than did land use alone. 5. Total phosphorus and total suspended solids were much better explained by land use within the stream ecotone in summer than in other seasons. However, total nitrogen, nitrate, orthophosphate and alkalinity were equally well explained by land use within the ecotone and throughout the whole catchment. Only total dissolved solids in summer and ammonium in autumn were explained better by the whole catchment than the ecotone. 6. Our results show that relatively coarse spatial databases can provide useful descriptors of regional water quality.},

abstract = {In this study, the water draining a catchment of 65 km2 in NW Spain was monitored over a 3-year period to examine temporal variability of five metal concentrations (Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn) in dissolved form and also in suspended solids (SS), under two different hydrological conditions - in baseflow and stormflow events. pH, SS and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were also examined as possible factors affecting metal transport mechanisms. The results showed that AlD, CuD, and ZnD were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) higher in stormflow events than in baseflow, while in SS, all metal concentrations decreased (p {\textless} 0.05) during stormflow events. The metal seasonal variability was also examined. In dissolved form, only FeD showed significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) between seasons, with higher concentrations in summer, independently of the hydrological conditions, while in SS, only CuSS during stormflow events showed concentrations significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.05) during summer than in the remainder seasons. The partition coefficients (K D) decreased significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) for all metals during stormflow events. K D correlations showed that SS and DOC were the main factors in controlling the K D of all metals, except the K D of Mn which did not depend on any of these variables in baseflow. Metal enrichment factors were significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.05) during baseflow than in events which were associated to SS source and size. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is a cornerstone therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). With increasing numbers of PVI procedures, demand arises to reduce the cumulative fluoroscopic radiation exposure for both the physician and the patient. New technologies are emerging to address this issue. Here, we report our first experiences with a new fluoroscopy integrating technology in addition to a current 3D-mapping system. The new fluoroscopy integrating system (FIS) with 3D-mapping was used prospectively in 15 patients with AF. Control PVI cases (n = 37) were collected retrospectively as a complete series. Total procedure time (skin to skin), fluoroscopic time, and dose-area-product (DAP) data were analyzed. All PVI procedures were performed by one experienced physician using a commercially available circular multipolar irrigated ablation catheter. All PVI procedures were successfully undertaken without major complications. Baseline characteristics of the two groups showed no significant differences. In the group using the FIS, the fluoroscopic time and DAP were significantly reduced from 571 +/- 187 seconds versus 1011 +/- 527 seconds (P = 0.0029) and 4342 +/- 2073 cGycm(2) versus 6208 +/- 3314 cGycm(2) (P = 0.049), respectively. Mean procedure time was not significantly affected and was 114 +/- 31 minutes versus 104 +/- 24 minutes (P = 0.23) by the FIS.The use of the new FIS with the current 3D-mapping system enables a significant reduction of the total fluoroscopy time and DAP compared to the previous combination of 3D-mapping system plus normal fluoroscopy during PVI utilizing a circular multipolar irrigated ablation catheter. However, the concomitant total procedure time is not affected. Thus, the new system reduces the radiation exposure for both the physicians and patients.},

abstract = {This paper presents a process for estimating pollutant loads from water quality data, to improve catchment-scale modelling in the region for resource management purposes. It describes a program to estimate suspended sediment, total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus loads to the Tuross estuary from the Tuross River catchment (1810 km2) of coastal southeast Australia. Event-based water quality sampling results obtained during storm events in 2005 are presented. Event 1, during July 2005 was the largest storm event in terms of peak flow for 3.5 years. Other events monitored were also in July, November and December 2005. The early July 2005 event had a flow-weighted mean suspended sediment (SS) concentration during the first 4 days of 63 mg L-1. Of the events monitored, this was unusual as it was preceded by drought and had the largest SS concentrations (peaking at 180 mg L-1) during the rising-stage. In contrast, the November event had a much lower flow-weighted SS mean (28 mg L-1), even though peak flow magnitudes were similar. The July and November 2005 events had peak flows of 12,360 and 11,330 ML day-1. Low-cost rising-stage siphon samplers were used to collect samples during the rapidly rising phase of these events. The use of such samplers and consideration of time-lead/lag flow adjustments, quantified using cross-correlation analysis to account for hysteresis effects, were incorporated into the load estimation techniques. The technique is a potentially useful approach for understanding relationships between water quality concentrations and flow for modelling catchment source strengths and transport processes.

abstract = {From headwaters to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a con-tinuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream conununities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjust-ments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a frame-work for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implica-tions of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are},

abstract = {While the influence of antecedent conditions on watershed function is widely recognized under typical hydrologic regimes, gaps remain in the context of extreme climate events (ECEs). ECEs are those events that far exceed seasonal norms of intensity, duration, or impact upon the physical environment or ecosystem. In this synthesis, we discuss the role of source availability and hydrologic connectivity on antecedent conditions and propose a conceptual framework to characterize system response to ECEs at the watershed scale. We present four case studies in detail that span a range of types of antecedent conditions and type of ECE to highlight important controls and feedbacks. Because ECEs have the potential to export large amounts of water and materials, their occurrence in sequence can disproportionately amplify the response. In fact, multiple events may not be considered extreme in isolation, but when they occur in close sequence they may lead to extreme responses in terms of both supply and transport capacity. Therefore, to advance our understanding of these complexities, we need continued development of a mechanistic understanding of how antecedent conditions set the stage for ECE response across multiple regions and climates, particularly since monitoring of these rare events is costly and difficult to obtain. Through focused monitoring of critical ecosystems during rare events we will also be able to extend and validate modeling studies. Cross-regional comparisons are also needed to define characteristics of resilient systems. These monitoring, modeling, and synthesis efforts are more critical than ever in light of changing climate regimes, intensification of human modifications of the landscape, and the disproportionate impact of ECEs in highly populated regions.},

abstract = {Snowmelt-runoff processes on frozen ground are poorly understood at the hillslope scale. This is especially true for hillslopes on the northern Great Plains of North America where long periods of snow-covered frozen ground with very shallow slopes mask any spatial patterns and process controls on connectivity and hillslope runoff generation. This study examines a 4.66 ha (46,600 m2) hillslope on the northern Great Plains during the 2014 spring snowmelt season to explore hillslope runoff processes. Specifically, we explore the spatial patterns of runoff production source areas and examine how surface topography and patterns of snow cover, snow water equivalent, soil water content, and thawed layer depth – which we measured on a 10 m grid across our 46,600 m2 hillslope – affect melt water partitioning and runoff connectivity. A key question was whether or not the controls on connectivity are consistent with the fill and spill mechanism found in rain-dominated and unfrozen soil domains. The contrast between the slow infiltration rates into frozen soil and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt delivery to the soil surface resulted in water accumulation in small depressions under the snowpack. Consequently, infiltration was minimal over the 12 day melt period. Instead, nested filling of micro- and meso-depressions was followed by macro-scale, whole-slope spilling. This spilling occurred when large patches of ponded water exceeded the storage capacity behind downslope micro barriers in the surface topography, and flows from them coalesced to drive a rapid increase in runoff at the hillslope outlet. These observations of ponded water and flowpaths followed mapable fill and spill locations based on 2 m resolution digital topographic analysis. Interestingly, while surface topography is relatively unimportant under unfrozen conditions at our site because of low relief and high infiltrability, surface topography shows episodically critical importance for connectivity and runoff generation when the ground is frozen.},

abstract = {C cycling and dissolved organic C (DOC) inputs to boreal aquatic systems probably will change substantially with climate change. DOC concentrations already are increasing in surface waters. Terrestrial C is a major source of C to boreal freshwater ecosystems, but the interface between these 2 ecosystems, the riparian zone, has not been studied often. To improve our understanding of the importance of terrestrial inputs of DOC to aquatic systems from surrounding forests, we followed the changes of DOC concentration along a continuum of precipitation, throughfall, soil water, ground water, lake, and brook water in a pristine, boreal, forested headwater catchment and developed a lake C balance based on terrestrial and lacustrine C fluxes. We also examined DOC quality changes using the ratio of absorbance at 465 and 665 nm (E4/E6). DOC concentrations increased from 2.4 mg/L in precipitation to 132.3 mg/L in soil water as water passed through the terrestrial ecosystem. DOC concentrations in the riparian zone were correlated with DOC concentrations in the adjacent outflowing brook but not in the headwater lake. E4/E6 ratios indicated that the DOC in precipitation and throughfall was dominated by higher molecular weight compounds and that the DOC in soil and ground water was dominated by lower molecular weight compounds. The input of terrestrial DOC to the aquatic ecosystem was estimated to be 5 to 13 g C m-2 y-1, which is small compared with the C fluxes between atmosphere and vegetation, but can significantly decrease the net ecosystem exchange of an old-growth forest catchment. Terrestrial DOC was a major source of C in the lake, rendering it heterotrophic. The DOC export (3 g DOC m-2 y-1) made up almost 70{\%} of total C export.},

However, existing applications are generally restricted to the implementation of Breiman's original algorithm for regression and classification problems, while numerous developments could be also useful in solving diverse practical problems in the water sector. Here we popularize RF and their variants for the practicing water scientist, and discuss related concepts and techniques, which have received less attention from the water science and hydrologic communities. In doing so, we review RF applications in water resources, highlight the potential of the original algorithm and its variants, and assess the degree of RF exploitation in a diverse range of applications. Relevant implementations of random forests, as well as related concepts and techniques in the R programming language, are also covered. Keywords:},

abstract = {Natural organic matter (NOM) is found in all surface, ground and soil waters. During recent decades, reports worldwide show a continuing increase in the color and NOM of the surface water, which has an adverse affect on drinking water purification. For several practical and hygienic reasons, the presence of NOM is undesirable in drinking water. Various technologies have been proposed for NOM removal with varying degrees of success. The properties and amount of NOM, however, can significantly affect the process efficiency. In order to improve and optimise these processes, the characterisation and quantification of NOM at different purification and treatment processes stages is important. It is also important to be able to understand and predict the reactivity of NOM or its fractions in different steps of the treatment. Methods used in the characterisation of NOM include resin adsorption, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The amount of NOM in water has been predicted with parameters including UV-Vis, total organic carbon (TOC), and specific UV-absorbance (SUVA). Recently, methods by which NOM structures can be more precisely determined have been developed; pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), multidimensional NMR techniques, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). The present review focuses on the methods used for characterisation and quantification of NOM in relation to drinking water treatment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The response of a stream ecosystem to disturbance in its watershed was investigated by comparing mass balances of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for a stream draining an undisturbed watershed with a stream draining a watershed that was clear-cut 2 yr before the study began. These second-order streams are in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina. Both streams had similar, elevated DOC concentrations (from {\textless}1 to 5 mg/L) during storms. Rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph also had similar DOC concentrations. During the growing season DOC concentration increased from headwater seep to the weir in the undisturbed stream under baseflow conditions. No significant longitudinal change was observed in the stream draining the clear-cut watershed. Hence concentration was consistently lower in baseflow samples during the growing season in the stream draining the clear-cut watershed. As a result annual DOC export from the clear-cut watershed was less (9.8-11.5 kg/ha) than from the reference watershed (14.6-15.1 kg/ha). The lower DOC export was partly due to reduced DOC inputs from throughfall and leaching of fresh litter, but most impor- tantly to lower DOC inputs in subsurface water and probably also less in-stream generation of DOC. The rate of recovery of this stream from disturbance is therefore dependent on the rate at which the terrestrial system recovers},

Overall survey results show general compliance with current US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) requirements, but there are major differences among practices in the areas where no specific USEPA guidelines or recommendations exist. Inconsistencies among various USEPA requirements and referenced documents (e.g., Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater) appear to create confusion for some survey participants in selected areas, particularly with respect to filter selection (pore size and type), filter cleaning, and sample filtration. It is expected that the survey results presented here will serve as a useful resource to drinking water practitioners and researchers on issues related to DOC and UV measurements and will provide valuable information for developing a unified SUVA protocol in a current AWWA Research Foundation project.},

abstract = {The flux of terrestrial C to rivers has increased relative to preindustrial levels, a fraction of which is aged dissolved organic C (DOC). In rivers, C is stored in sediments, exported to the ocean, or (bio)chemically processed and released as CO2. Disturbance changes land cover and hydrology, shifting potential sources and processing of DOC. To investigate the likely sources of aged DOC, we analyzed radiocarbon ages, chemical, and spectral properties of DOC and major ions from 19 rivers draining the coterminous U.S. and Arctic. DOC optics indicated that the majority is exported as aromatic, high molecular weight, modern molecules while aged DOC tended to consist of smaller, microbial degradation products. Aged DOC exports, observed regularly in arid basins and during base flow in arctic rivers, are associated with higher proportion of mineral weathering products, suggesting deeper flows paths. These patterns also indicate potential for production of microbial byproducts as DOC ages in soil and water with longer periods of time between production and transport. Thus, changes in hydrology associated with landscape alteration (e.g., tilling or shifting climates) that can result in deeper flow paths or longer residence times will likely lead to a greater proportion of aged carbon in riverine exports.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important to ecosystem functioning and of high interest to drinking water treatment processes as it is costly to remove from source water. The effects of land use change (e.g. forest harvest) on DOC are not fully understood. Past studies of the effects of forestry on DOC have found mixed results, and covariate effects complicate mechanistic understanding and may underlie regional differences. DOC is typically highest during storm events, and detailed time-resolved measurements of DOC over longer periods are just becoming feasible with advances in in situ sensors. In this thesis, I investigated DOC concentration and character for headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest history in the UBC Malcolm Knapp Research Forest near Maple Ridge, British Columbia, and discussed implications for water treatment through expert interviews with water treatment engineers at Metro Vancouver. I took a two-pronged approach to the field study by measuring not only temporally detailed DOC concentration at two contrasting sites, but also spatially broad DOC concentration and character at 24 sites for six time points during the same study period. From the temporal analysis, I found base flow DOC concentration to be lower in the clear cut stream (Clear cut: 2.26 ± 0.43 mg/L; Forested: 4.30 ± 0.83 mg/L), but storm response to be stronger (mean increase DOC: Clear cut: 2.42 mg/L, Forested: 1.99 mg/L). Decreased DOC concentration after cutting may be due to reductions in carbon inputs like leaf litter, though differences in drainage area and the presence of a bog lake may also account for some of the observed difference. Elevated storm responses may be due to changes in flow paths related to forest harvesting. From the broad sampling analysis, I found differences in DOC character between the two land use types: DOC in clear cut sites was more protein-like whereas DOC in forested sites it was more humic-like, although once random factors were taken into account in generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), the relationship was no longer significant. Using categorization and regression tree (CART) modeling, I found drainage area to be the most important covariate related to DOC followed by time of year (i.e. seasonality).},

While multimetric indices have been used to show community composition, pollution tolerance, species diversity, and trophic structure with a combined index, the specific environmental factors that drive biological communities may be better explained through the use of multivariate statistical techniques. Macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages were sampled along with water quality, landuse and qualitative and quantitative habitat assessments from forty-nine sites throughout the Choctawhatchee-Pea, a southeastern U.S. watershed. Multivariate statistical analyses of habitat, water quality, and land-use data were used to determine the relationship between environmental variables and the dependent biological variables, macroinvertebrate and fish community structure. Sampling of biological and environmental data showed that there was a great deal of homogeneity within the watershed, which complicated the task of identifying environmental influences on biological assemblages. Macro-invertebrate and fish assemblages of the Choctawhatchee-Pea watershed were similar in their response to environmental conditions with water chemistry having the greatest relationship to macro-invertebrate and fish community structure followed by instream habitat and land use.

abstract = {Dynamics of river dissolved organic matter (DOM) during storm events have profound influences on the downstream aquatic ecosystem and drinking water safety. This study investigated temporal variations in DOM during four storm events in two forest headwater streams (the EH and JH brooks, South Korea) and the impacts on the disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formation potential. The within-event variations of most DOM quantity parameters were similar to the flow rate in the EH but not in the larger JH brook. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis with the flow rate in the EH and JH brooks, respectively, indicating the importance of both flow path and DOM source pool size in determining the effects of storm events. The stream DOM became less aromatic/humified from the first to the last event in both brooks, probably due to the increasing fresh plant pool and the decreasing leaf litter pool during the course of rainy season. The DOC export during each event increased 1.3-2.7- and 1.1-7.0-fold by stormflows in the EH and JH brooks, respectively. The leaf litter and soil together was the major DOM source, particularly during early events. The enhanced DOM export probably increases the risks of DBPs formation in disinfection, as indicated by a strong correlation observed between DOC and trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP). High correlations between two humic-like fluorescent components and THMFP further suggested the potential of assessing THMFP with in situ fluorescence sensors during storms.},

abstract = {The boreal landscape is a complex, spatiotemporally varying mosaic of forest and mire landscape elements that control surface water hydrology and chemistry. Here, we assess long-term water quality time series from three nested headwater streams draining upland forest (C2), peat/mire (C4) and mixed (C7) (forest and mire) catchments. Acid deposition in this region is low and is further declining. Temporal trends in weather and runoff (1981-2008), dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] (1993-2010) and other water quality parameters (1987-2011) were assessed. There was no significant annual trend in precipitation or runoff. However, runoff increased in March and declined in May. This suggested an earlier snowmelt regime in recent years. Significant monotonic increasing trends in air temperature and length of growing season suggested a decrease in snowfall and less spring runoff. Stream [DOC] was positively correlated with some trace metals (copper, iron and zinc) and negatively with several other chemical parameters (e.g. sulfate, conductivity, calcium). Both sulfate and conductivity showed declining trends, while a significant increase was observed in pH during winter and spring. Calcium and magnesium showed monotonic decreasing trends. The declining trajectories of stream base cation and sulfate concentrations during other times of the year were not accompanied by changes in pH and alkalinity. These results indicate subtle effects of recovery from acidification. Water temperature increased significantly both annually and in most months. A simultaneous monotonic increase in iron (Fe) and [DOC] in autumn suggests co-transport of Fe-DOC in the form of organometallic complexes. A monotonic increase in UV absorbance in most months without co-occurring changes in DOC trend suggests a shift in DOC quality to a more humicrich type. The observed increase in soil solution [DOC] and subtle trends in stream [DOC] suggest that climate rather than recovery from acidification is the dominant driver of DOC trends in the Svartberget catchment. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {It is important to understand how dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is processed and transported through stream networks because DOC is a master water quality variable in aquatic ecosystems. High-frequency sampling is necessary to capture important, rapid shifts in DOC source, concentration, and composition (i.e. quality) in streams. Until recently, this high-frequency sampling was logistically difficult or impossible. However, this type of sampling can now be conducted using in-situ optical measurements through long-term, field-deployable fluorometers and spectrophotometers. The optical data collected from these instruments can quantify both DOC concentration and composition properties (e.g., specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio, and fluorescence index). Previously, the use of these sensors was limited to a small number of specialized users, mainly in Europe and North America, where they were used predominantly in marine DOC studies as well as water treatment and management infrastructure. However, recent field demonstrations across a wide range of river systems reveals a large potential for the use of these instruments in freshwater environments, heightening interest and demand across multiple environmental research and management disciplines. Hence, this review provides an up-to-date synthesis on 1) the use of spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool in stream DOC studies, 2) the instrumentation, its applications, potential limitations and future considerations, and 3) the new watershed DOC research directions made possible via these in-situ optical sensors.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that affect freshwater export of terrestrially derived carbon is key to creating a comprehensive model of stream ecology and to developing an accurate carbon budget. Though efforts have been made to quantify carbon in Pacific Northwest forests, little is known about the carbon in their freshwater systems. To begin informing this knowledge gap, we collected dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and water quality data along the stream networks of four small, fish-bearing watersheds in the Olympic Experimental State Forest on the Olympic Peninsula, WA during the summer and fall of 2018. Conditional reference random forest models were used to explore how landscape characteristics and climatic variables affect the spatial and temporal variability of carbon composition and water quality parameters. We found that slope-related variables and precipitation were the primary drivers of carbon export. The strengths and magnitudes of these relationships were different for the summer and fall. We also identified two pools of different carbon composition that were present in three of the four study watersheds. The results of this study give us a first look at the drivers of carbon export and the quantity and quality of carbon being exported through freshwater systems. Our work also advises on the spatial and temporal considerations of stream carbon monitoring. We identify three key questions to pursue in future studies that will improve our understanding of stream carbon on the Olympic Peninsula and allow us to monitor it going forward. Our results indicate that future research should explore seasonal variability, hyporheic influences, and management impacts on carbon dynamics},

This time-series dataset was gathered from three contiguous river sub-catchments, the Black, the Glenamong and the Srahrevagh, in a blanket peatland catchment system in western Ireland, and it was used to identify the drivers that best explained observed temporal change in river colour. The data were also used to estimate annual DOC loads from each catchment. General additive mixed modelling was used to identify the principle environmental drivers of water colour in the rivers, while wavelet cross-correlation analysis was used to identify common frequencies in correlations. At 130mgPtCoL-1, the mean colour levels in the Srahrevagh (the sub-catchment with lowest rainfall and higher forest cover) were almost 50{\%} higher than those from the Black and Glenamong, at 95 and 84mgPtCoL-1 respectively. The decomposition of the colour datasets revealed similar multi-annual, annual and event-based (random component) trends, illustrating that environmental drivers operated synchronously at each of these temporal scales. For both the Black and its nested Srahrevagh catchment, three variables (soil temperature, soil moisture deficit, SMD, and the weekly North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO) combined to explain 54{\%} and 58{\%} of the deviance in colour respectively. In the Glenamong, which had steeper topography and a higher percentage of peat intersected by streams, soil temperature, the log of stream discharge and the NAO explained 66{\%} of the colour concentrations. Cross-wavelet time-series analysis between river colour and each environmental driver revealed a significant high common power relationship at an annual time step. Each relationship however, varied in phase, further highlighting the complexity of the mechanisms driving river colour in the sub-catchments. The estimated mean annual DOC loads for the Black and Glenamong rivers to Lough Feeagh were similar at 15.0 and 14.7tCkm-21 respectively. The important role of past and current precipitation and, in particular, temperature emphasises the vulnerability of blanket peatland carbon stores to projected climate change and highlights the interaction of local and regional climate in controlling aquatic carbon export. Our results show that water colour (and hence DOC) concentrations can vary considerably between neighbouring catchments and also that regional-scale climatic drivers control the trends in intra-and inter-annual flux of DOC through the system. The combination of locally determined concentrations and regionally controlled fluxes produces aquatic DOC loads that vary over both the annual cycle and over multiple years.},

abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is being increasingly used to help drinking water utilities meet finished water quality regulations, but its influence on disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors and DBP formation is not completely understood. This study investigated the effect of medium pressure (MP) UV combined with chlorination/chloramination on the fluorescent fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from a United States surface water with median total organic carbon content. Parallel factor analysis was used to understand how UV may alter the capacity of DOM to form DBPs of potential human health concern. The production of chloral hydrate and cyanogen chloride from MP UV followed by chlorine or chloramine, respectively, correlated with a decrease in fluorescence intensity of a protein/tryptophan-like component (R2=0.79-0.99) and a humic-like component (R2=0.91-1.00). This suggests that the UV-induced precursors to these compounds originated from DOM with similar characteristics to these components. The fluorescent DOM components identified in this study are similar to reoccurring components that have been previously identified in a range of raw and treated waters, and this work demonstrates the value of using fluorescence analysis of DOM to understand the relationships between DOM source and DBP formation under a range of treatment conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The chemical compositions were characterized by Ca–HCO3 in the glacier snow zone, Mg–Ca–SO4–HCO3 in the alpine cold desert zone, Ca–Mg–HCO3 in the marsh meadow zone, Ca–Mg–HCO3 in the alpine shrub zone, and Na–Ca–SO4 in the mountain grassland zone. The end-member mixing model was employed for hydrograph separation. The results showed that during the melting period Mafengou River water was recharged by glacier–snow melt water about 34{\%}, thawed frozen soil water in each of the landscape zones about 12{\%}, and groundwater about 54{\%}. This study suggested that Mafengou River water during the melting period was mainly recharged by glacier–snow melt water, groundwater and thawed frozen soil water.},

abstract = {Six methods were compared for calculating annual stream exports of sulfate, nitrate, calcium, magnesium and aluminum from six small Appalachian watersheds. Approximately 250-400 stream samples and concurrent stream flow measurements were collected during baseflows and storm flows for the 1989 water year at five Pennsylvania watersheds and during the 1989-1992 water years at a West Virginia watershed. Continuous stream flow records were also collected at each watershed. Solute exports were calculated from the complete data set using six different scenarios ranging from instantaneous monthly measurements of stream chemistry and stream flow, to intensive monitoring of storm flow events and multiple regression equations. The results for five of the methods were compared with the regression method because statistically significant models were developed and the regression equations allowed for prediction of solute concentrations during unsampled storm flows. Results indicated that continuous stream flow measurement was critical to producing exports within 10{\%} of regression estimates. For solutes whose concentrations were not correlated strongly with stream flow, weekly grab samples combined with continuous records of stream flow were sufficient to produce export estimates within 10{\%} of the regression method. For solutes whose concentrations were correlated strongly with stream flow, more intensive sampling during storm flows or the use of multiple regression equations were the most appropriate methods, especially for watersheds where stream flows changed most quickly. Concentration-stream flow relationships, stream hydrological response, available resources and required level of accuracy of chemical budgets should be considered when choosing a method for calculating solute exports. {\textcopyright} 1997 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Natural organic matter (NOM) is found in all surface, ground and soil waters. During recent decades, reports worldwide show a continuing increase in the color and NOM of the surface water, which has an adverse affect on drinking water purification. For several practical and hygienic reasons, the presence of NOM is undesirable in drinking water. Various technologies have been proposed for NOM removal with varying degrees of success. The properties and amount of NOM, however, can significantly affect the process efficiency. In order to improve and optimise these processes, the characterisation and quantification of NOM at different purification and treatment processes stages is important. It is also important to be able to understand and predict the reactivity of NOM or its fractions in different steps of the treatment. Methods used in the characterisation of NOM include resin adsorption, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The amount of NOM in water has been predicted with parameters including UV-Vis, total organic carbon (TOC), and specific UV-absorbance (SUVA). Recently, methods by which NOM structures can be more precisely determined have been developed; pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), multidimensional NMR techniques, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). The present review focuses on the methods used for characterisation and quantification of NOM in relation to drinking water treatment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Streams and rivers are important pathways for the export of atmospherically deposited mercury (Hg) from watersheds. Dissolved Hg (HgD) is strongly associated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream water, but the ratio of HgD to DOC is highly variable between watersheds. In this study, the HgD:DOC ratios from 19 watersheds were evaluated with respect to Hg wet deposition and watershed soil organic carbon (SOC) content. On a subset of sites where data were available, DOC quality measured by specific ultra violet absorbance at 254 nm, was considered as an additional factor that may influence HgD:DOC . No significant relationship was found between Hg wet deposition and HgD:DOC, but SOC content (g m22) was able to explain 81{\%} of the variance in the HgD:DOC ratio (ng mg21) following the form: HgD:DOC517.8*SOC20.41. The inclusion of DOC quality as a secondary predictor variable explained only an additional 1{\%} of the variance. A mathematical framework to interpret the observed power-law relationship between HgD:DOC and SOC suggests Hg supply limitation for adsorption to soils with relatively large carbon pools. With SOC as a primary factor controlling the association of HgD with DOC, SOC data sets may be utilized to predict stream HgD:DOC ratios on a more geographically widespread basis. In watersheds where DOC data are available, estimates of HgD may be readily obtained. Future Hg emissions policies must consider soil-mediated processes that affect the transport of Hg and DOC from terrestrial watersheds to streams for accurate predictions of water quality impacts.},

abstract = {Information on water quality, in particular on sediment, phosphorus and nitrogen exports from catchments, is required by catchment managers and other stakeholder groups to determine appropriate management options for water quality issues. However intensive spatial and temporal data on concentrations or loads of these nutrients is relatively scarce. Given this constraint, nutrient export models which can provide useful information on nutrient loads with only sparse data inputs are required. In addition, more complex physics and conceptually based models which are commonly available worldwide are often inappropriate for predicting loads in catchments. Consequently, models of a simpler conceptual and/or empirical type are used where input data are sparse and key processes are catchment dependent. This paper compares four such models (CMSS, AQUALM, Moss model and IHACRES-WQ) and several methods based on direct estimation for their ability to predict loads in Australian catchment situations. The implications of the limited available input data sets for load prediction in Australian catchments are discussed. In particular the importance of coordinated data collection over longer time periods and sufficiently fine temporal scales, covering a broad range of event sizes, is emphasised. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Drinking water purveyors are increasingly relying on land conservation and management to ensure the safety of the water that they provide to consumers. To cost-effectively implement any such landscape initiatives, resources must be targeted to the appropriate spatial scale to address quality impairments of concern in a cost-effective manner. Using data gathered from 40 Canadian rivers across four ecozones, we examined the spatial scales at which land use was most closely associated with drinking source water quality metrics. Exploratory linear mixed-effects models accounting for climatic, hydrological, and physiographic variation among sites suggested that different spatial areas of land-use influence drinking source water quality depending on the parameter and season investigated. Escherichia coli spatial variability was only associated with land use at a local (5-10 km) spatial scale. Turbidity measures exhibited a complex association with land use, suggesting that the land-use areas of greatest influence can range from a 1 km subcatchment to the entire watershed depending on the season. Total organic carbon concentrations were only associated with land use characterized at the entire watershed scale. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index was used to calculate a composite measure of seasonal drinking source water quality but did not provide additional information beyond the analyses of individual parameters. These results suggest that entire watershed management is required to safeguard drinking water sources with more focused efforts at targeted spatial scales to reduce specific risk parameters.

To understand how freeze-thaw cycles affect runoff generation processes in permafrost catchments, a typical headwater catchment with continuous permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau was measured. A new approach is presented in this study to account for runoff processes on the spring thawing period and autumn freezing period, when runoff generation clearly differs from that of non-permafrost catchments. This approach introduces a soil temperature-based water saturation function and modifies the soil water storage curve with a soil temperature threshold. The results show that surface soil thawing induced saturation excess runoff and subsurface interflow account for approximately 66–86{\%} and 14–34{\%} of total spring runoff, respectively, and the soil temperature significantly affects the runoff generation pattern, the runoff composition and the runoff coefficient with the enlargement of the active layer. The suprapermafrost groundwater discharge decreases exponentially with active layer frozen processes during autumn runoff recession, whereas the ratio of groundwater discharge to total runoff and the direct surface runoff coefficient simultaneously increase. The bidirectional freezing of the active layer controls and changes the autumn runoff processes and runoff composition. The new approach could be used to further develop hydrological models of cold regions dominated by permafrost.},

abstract = {Specific UV absorbance (SUVA) is defined as the UV absorbance of a water sample at a given wavelength normalized for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. Our data indicate that SUVA, determined at 254 nm, is strongly correlated with percent aromaticity as determined by 13C NMR for 13 organic matter isolates obtained from a variety of aquatic environments. SUVA, therefore, is shown to be a useful parameter for estimating the dissolved aromatic carbon content in aquatic systems. Experiments involving the reactivity of DOC with chlorine and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), however, show a wide range of reactivity for samples with similar SUVA values. These results indicate that, while SUVA measurements are good predictors of general chemical characteristics of DOC, they do not provide information about reactivity of DOC derived from different types of source materials. Sample pH, nitrate, and iron were found to influence SUVA measurements.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that affect freshwater export of terrestrially derived carbon is key to creating a comprehensive model of stream ecology and to developing an accurate carbon budget. Though efforts have been made to quantify carbon in Pacific Northwest forests, little is known about the carbon in their freshwater systems. To begin informing this knowledge gap, we collected dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and water quality data along the stream networks of four small, fish-bearing watersheds in the Olympic Experimental State Forest on the Olympic Peninsula, WA during the summer and fall of 2018. Conditional reference random forest models were used to explore how landscape characteristics and climatic variables affect the spatial and temporal variability of carbon composition and water quality parameters. We found that slope-related variables and precipitation were the primary drivers of carbon export. The strengths and magnitudes of these relationships were different for the summer and fall. We also identified two pools of different carbon composition that were present in three of the four study watersheds. The results of this study give us a first look at the drivers of carbon export and the quantity and quality of carbon being exported through freshwater systems. Our work also advises on the spatial and temporal considerations of stream carbon monitoring. We identify three key questions to pursue in future studies that will improve our understanding of stream carbon on the Olympic Peninsula and allow us to monitor it going forward. Our results indicate that future research should explore seasonal variability, hyporheic influences, and management impacts on carbon dynamics},

abstract = {Understanding how water and solutes enter and propagate through freshwater landscapes in the Anthropocene is critical to protecting and restoring aquatic ecosystems and ensuring human water security. However, high hydrochemical variability in headwater streams, where most carbon and nutrients enter river networks, has hindered effective modelling and management. We developed an analytical framework informed by landscape ecology and catchment hydrology to quantify spatiotemporal variability across scales, which we tested in 56 headwater catchments, sampled periodically over 12 years in western France. Unexpectedly, temporal variability in dissolved carbon, nutrients and major ions was preserved moving downstream and spatial patterns of water chemistry were stable on annual to decadal timescales, partly because of synchronous variation in solute concentrations. These findings suggest that while concentration and flux cannot be extrapolated among subcatchments, periodic sampling of headwaters provides valuable information about solute sources and subcatchment resilience to disturbance.},

A method is presented for measuring sediment originating from a road segment for individual storm events and quantifying the delivery to streams. Site selection criteria are listed to describe the characteristics for efficient data collection and analysis. The method describes equipment used to quantify sediment transport—data loggers, a rain gage, a traffic counter, Parshall flumes with stilling wells, hydrostatic pressure transducers, and water pumping samplers—as well as variables associated with sediment production—road surfacing material, traffic intensity, gradient, age, construction method, and precipitation. A sampling protocol that worked well for the forest roads in southeast Alaska and can be adapted for use in other regions also is described. Examples of data collection and analysis are explained both for sites near the road and downstream sites for sediment delivery quantification. This method can be used to determine the downstream transport of sediment originating from roads and developing regression models or validating existing sediment models.},

abstract = {Understanding of the processes that control CO2 concentrations in the aquatic environment has been hampered by the absence of a direct method to make continuous measurements over both short- and long-term time intervals. We describe an in situ method in which a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor is enclosed in a water impermeable, gas permeable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane and deployed in a freshwater environment. This allows measurements of CO2 concentration to be made directly at a specific depth in the water column without the need for pumps or reagents. We demonstrate the potential of the method using examples from different aquatic environments characterized by a range of CO2 concentrations (0.5–8.0 mg CO2-C L-1, equivalent to ca 40–650 $\mu$mol CO2 L-1). These comprise streams and ponds from tropical, temperate and boreal regions. Data derived from the sensor was compared with direct measurements of CO2 concentrations using headspace analysis. Sensor performance following long-term ({\textgreater}6 months) field deployment conformed to manufacturers' specifications, with no drift detected. We conclude that the sensor-based method is a robust, accurate and responsive method, with a wide range of potential applications, particularly when combined with other in situ sensor-based measurements of related variables.},

abstract = {Online monitoring dissolved organic matter (DOM) is urgent for water treatment management. In this study, high performance size exclusion chromatography with multi-UV absorbance and multi-emission fluorescence scans were applied to spectrally characterize samples from 16 drinking water sources across Yangzi River and Huai River Watersheds. The UV absorbance indices at 254 nm and 280 nm referred to the same DOM components and concentration, and the 280 nm UV light could excite both protein-like and humic-like fluorescence. Hence a novel UV fluorescence sensor was developed out using only one UV280 light-emitting diode (LED) as light source. For all samples, enhanced coagulation was mainly effective for large molecular weight biopolymers; while anion exchange further substantially removed humic substances. During chlorination tests, UVA280 and UVA254 showed similar correlations with yields of disinfection byproducts (DBPs); the humic-like fluorescence obtained from LED sensors correlated well with both trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids yields, while the correlation between protein-like fluorescence and trihalomethanes was relatively poor. Anion exchange exhibited more reduction of DBPs yields as well as UV absorbance and fluorescence signals than enhanced coagulation. The results suggest that the LED UV fluorescence sensors are very promising for online monitoring DOM and predicting DBPs formation potential during water treatment.},

abstract = {Dynamics of river dissolved organic matter (DOM) during storm events have profound influences on the downstream aquatic ecosystem and drinking water safety. This study investigated temporal variations in DOM during four storm events in two forest headwater streams (the EH and JH brooks, South Korea) and the impacts on the disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formation potential. The within-event variations of most DOM quantity parameters were similar to the flow rate in the EH but not in the larger JH brook. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis with the flow rate in the EH and JH brooks, respectively, indicating the importance of both flow path and DOM source pool size in determining the effects of storm events. The stream DOM became less aromatic/humified from the first to the last event in both brooks, probably due to the increasing fresh plant pool and the decreasing leaf litter pool during the course of rainy season. The DOC export during each event increased 1.3-2.7- and 1.1-7.0-fold by stormflows in the EH and JH brooks, respectively. The leaf litter and soil together was the major DOM source, particularly during early events. The enhanced DOM export probably increases the risks of DBPs formation in disinfection, as indicated by a strong correlation observed between DOC and trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP). High correlations between two humic-like fluorescent components and THMFP further suggested the potential of assessing THMFP with in situ fluorescence sensors during storms.},

abstract = {Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are gaining traction as they offer mineralization potential rather than transferring contaminants between media. However, AOPs operated with limited energy and/or chemical inputs can exacerbate disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation, even as precursors such as dissolved organic carbon, UV254, and specific UV absorbance (SUVA) decrease. This study examined the relationship between DBP precursors and formation using TiO2 photocatalysis experiments, external AOP and non-AOP data, and predictive DBP models. The top-performing indicator, SUVA, generally correlated positively with trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, but limited-energy photocatalysis yielded contrasting negative correlations. The accuracy of predicted DBP values from models based on bulk parameters was generally poor, regardless of use and extent of AOP treatment and type of source water. Though performance improved for scenarios bounded by conditions used in model development, only 0.5{\%} of the model/dataset pairings satisfied all measured parameter boundary conditions, thereby introducing skepticism toward model usefulness. Study findings suggest that caution should be employed when using bulk indicators and/or models as a metric for AOP mitigation of DBP formation potential, particularly for limited-energy/chemical inputs.},

The poorest members of society, unable to afford sterilized or bottled water, suffer the greatest impacts. Similar problems affect the rural poor as well of course, and sometimes these can be even more severe.

abstract = {The response of a stream ecosystem to disturbance in its watershed was investigated by comparing mass balances of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for a stream draining an undisturbed watershed with a stream draining a watershed that was clear-cut 2 yr before the study began. These second-order streams are in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina. Both streams had similar, elevated DOC concentrations (from {\textless}1 to 5 mg/L) during storms. Rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph also had similar DOC concentrations. During the growing season DOC concentration increased from headwater seep to the weir in the undisturbed stream under baseflow conditions. No significant longitudinal change was observed in the stream draining the clear-cut watershed. Hence concentration was consistently lower in baseflow samples during the growing season in the stream draining the clear-cut watershed. As a result annual DOC export from the clear-cut watershed was less (9.8-11.5 kg/ha) than from the reference watershed (14.6-15.1 kg/ha). The lower DOC export was partly due to reduced DOC inputs from throughfall and leaching of fresh litter, but most impor- tantly to lower DOC inputs in subsurface water and probably also less in-stream generation of DOC. The rate of recovery of this stream from disturbance is therefore dependent on the rate at which the terrestrial system recovers},

abstract = {In this study, the disinfection byproduct formation potential (DBPFP) of three surface waters with the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content of 2.5, 5.2, and 7.9. mg/L was investigated. The formation and distribution of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were evaluated. Samples collected from three surface waters in China were fractionated based on molecular weight and hydrophobicity. The raw water containing more hydrophobic (Ho) fraction exhibited higher formation potentials of haloacetic acid and trihalomethane. The DBPFP of the surface waters did not correlate with the DOC value. The values of DBPFP per DOC were correlated with the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) for Ho and Hi fractions. The obtained results suggested that SUVA cannot reveal the ability of reactive sites to form disinfection byproducts for waters with few aromatic structures. Combined with the analysis of FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the raw waters and the corresponding fractions, it was concluded that the Ho fraction with phenolic hydroxyl and conjugated double bonds was responsible for the production of trichloromethanes and trichloroacetic acids. The Hi fraction with amino and carboxyl groups had the potential to form dichloroacetic acids and chlorinated trihalomethanes. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Hydrological events, driven by rainfall, control the amount and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) mobilized through river networks. In forested watersheds, the concentration, composition, and reactivity of DOM exported changes as baseflow transitions to storm flow, with major implications to downstream biogeochemistry. Hysteresis describes an observed difference between in-stream solute concentration/signal and discharge. By studying the relationship between DOM and stream discharge, we refine our understanding of the environmental and hydrological factors that influence the quantity and quality of stream DOM. The main objective of this study was to track hysteretic changes in riverine DOM molecular composition during storm events. Samples were collected from nested sites within the Passumpsic River catchment (Vermont, USA), a tributary of the Connecticut River. High-resolution monitoring of fluorescent DOM (via in situ sensors) and automated collection of discrete samples captured short-term, hydrologically driven variations in DOM concentration and composition. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed an enrichment in aliphatic compounds at storm onset, while aromatic and polyphenolic compounds were more enriched at peak discharge. Molecular hysteresis patterns were similar across stream orders, indicating that fresh, terrigenous DOM is quickly shunted downstream, through the river network, during pulses of high discharge.},

These results reinforce the hypothesis that DHAAs and THAAs form through different precursors and reaction pathways. Strong correlation between SUVA and UTOX was also observed during chloramination. However, no significant relationship was observed between SUVA and chloramination THMs and DHAAs. Overall, SUVA is a good indicator for the formation of unknown DBPs.

abstract = {The boreal landscape is a complex, spatiotemporally varying mosaic of forest and mire landscape elements that control surface water hydrology and chemistry. Here, we assess long-term water quality time series from three nested headwater streams draining upland forest (C2), peat/mire (C4) and mixed (C7) (forest and mire) catchments. Acid deposition in this region is low and is further declining. Temporal trends in weather and runoff (1981-2008), dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] (1993-2010) and other water quality parameters (1987-2011) were assessed. There was no significant annual trend in precipitation or runoff. However, runoff increased in March and declined in May. This suggested an earlier snowmelt regime in recent years. Significant monotonic increasing trends in air temperature and length of growing season suggested a decrease in snowfall and less spring runoff. Stream [DOC] was positively correlated with some trace metals (copper, iron and zinc) and negatively with several other chemical parameters (e.g. sulfate, conductivity, calcium). Both sulfate and conductivity showed declining trends, while a significant increase was observed in pH during winter and spring. Calcium and magnesium showed monotonic decreasing trends. The declining trajectories of stream base cation and sulfate concentrations during other times of the year were not accompanied by changes in pH and alkalinity. These results indicate subtle effects of recovery from acidification. Water temperature increased significantly both annually and in most months. A simultaneous monotonic increase in iron (Fe) and [DOC] in autumn suggests co-transport of Fe-DOC in the form of organometallic complexes. A monotonic increase in UV absorbance in most months without co-occurring changes in DOC trend suggests a shift in DOC quality to a more humicrich type. The observed increase in soil solution [DOC] and subtle trends in stream [DOC] suggest that climate rather than recovery from acidification is the dominant driver of DOC trends in the Svartberget catchment. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {Dynamics of river dissolved organic matter (DOM) during storm events have profound influences on the downstream aquatic ecosystem and drinking water safety. This study investigated temporal variations in DOM during four storm events in two forest headwater streams (the EH and JH brooks, South Korea) and the impacts on the disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formation potential. The within-event variations of most DOM quantity parameters were similar to the flow rate in the EH but not in the larger JH brook. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis with the flow rate in the EH and JH brooks, respectively, indicating the importance of both flow path and DOM source pool size in determining the effects of storm events. The stream DOM became less aromatic/humified from the first to the last event in both brooks, probably due to the increasing fresh plant pool and the decreasing leaf litter pool during the course of rainy season. The DOC export during each event increased 1.3-2.7- and 1.1-7.0-fold by stormflows in the EH and JH brooks, respectively. The leaf litter and soil together was the major DOM source, particularly during early events. The enhanced DOM export probably increases the risks of DBPs formation in disinfection, as indicated by a strong correlation observed between DOC and trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP). High correlations between two humic-like fluorescent components and THMFP further suggested the potential of assessing THMFP with in situ fluorescence sensors during storms.},

@article{Gingold2014,
abstract = {Fluoroscopy, or real-time projection X-ray imaging, has been in clinical use since shortly after Roentgen's discovery of X-rays. Early fluoroscopes consisted simply of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which the patient was placed. After passing through the patient, the remnant beam impinged upon the fluorescent screen and produced a visible glow, which was directly observed by the practitioner. In modern systems, the fluorescent screen is coupled to an electronic device that amplifies and transforms the glowing light into a video signal suitable for presentation on an electronic display. One benefit of the modern system compared to the earlier approach is that the fluoroscopist need not stand in close proximity to the fluorescent screen in order to observe the live image. This results in a substantial reduction in radiation dose to the fluoroscopist. Patients receive less radiation dose as well, because of the amplification and overall efficiency of the imaging system. Fluoroscopy differs from most other X-ray imaging in that the images produced appear in real-time, allowing evaluation of dynamic biological processes and guiding interventions. Electronic fluoroscopy systems create this perception by capturing and displaying images at a high frame rate, typically 25 or 30 frames per second. At these frame rates, the human visual system cannot distinguish frame-to-frame variation and motion appears to be continuous, without visible flicker. To achieve high frame rates while keeping cumulative radiation dose to a reasonable level, the radiation dose to the image receptor per image (i.e., per frame) must be kept quite low, about 0.1{\%} of the dose used in radiography. Fluoroscopic images appear with an inverted grayscale (black/white is reversed) compared with standard radiographs. This convention is derivative of the appearance of the early non-intensified fluoroscopic screens, and it has been retained in the digital age even though the capability now exists to digitally reverse the grayscale.},

The River Continuum Concept (RCC) represents a synthesis of these ideas. Suggestions are made for clarifying, expanding, and refining the RCC to encompass broader spatial and temporal scales. Factors important in this regard include climate and geology, tributaries, location-specific lithology and geomorphology, and long-term changes imposed by man. It appears that most riverine ecosystems can be accommodated within this expanded conceptual framework and that the RCC continues to represent a useful paradigm for understanding and comparing the ecology of streams and rivers.},

@article{Peuravuori1997,
abstract = {The number- and weight-averaged molecular weights of different isolated humic fractions and unfractionated organic matter from natural water samples were measured using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The chromatograms obtained, with sodium acetate as the mobile phase on a TSK G3000SW high-speed column, provided illustrative information about the nature of the dissolved organic matter that was not available with phosphate buffer eluents. The calibration of the column system merely with protein standards generated misleading information about the molecular weight and size distribution of humic solutes. Instead, the present results support the utilization of polystyrene-sulphonates (PSS) either alone or together with certain other model compounds for the calibration of HPSEC in studying molecular weights of humic solutes. The data obtained with the HPSEC system indicate that the average molecular weight of humic solutes is distinctly lower than is generally assumed. Besides, aquatic humic solutes also contain some very large-sized though minor constituents, leading to a fairly polydisperse mixture. Number-averaged molecular weights obtained using the HPSEC system were 4-5-fold greater than those from vapour-pressure osmometry. Bulk spectroscopic properties such as molar absorptivity at 280 nm and the quotient, E2/E3, correlated strongly with the total aromaticity and averaged molecular weights of all the humic solutes. This observation suggests that bulk spectroscopic properties can be applied, as a first approximation, for estimating the size of humic solutes and their aromaticity in natural surface waters.},

abstract = {To better understand the effect of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transported by hydrological processes (rainfall, throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water; 0–20 cm) on soil respiration in tropical rainforests, we detected the DOC flux in rainfall, throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water (0–20 cm), compared the seasonality of $\delta$13CDOC in each hydrological process, and $\delta$13C in leaves, litter, and surface soil, and analysed the throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water (0–20 cm) effect on soil respiration in a tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna, south-west China. Results showed that the surface soil intercepted 94.4 ± 1.2 {\%} of the annual litter leachate DOC flux and is a sink for DOC. The throughfall and litter leachate DOC fluxes amounted to 6.81 and 7.23 {\%} of the net ecosystem exchange respectively, indicating that the DOC flux through hydrological processes is an important component of the carbon budget, and may be an important link between hydrological processes and soil respiration in a tropical rainforest. Even the variability in soil respiration is more dependent on the hydrologically transported water than DOC flux insignificantly, soil temperature, and soil-water content (at 0–20 cm). The difference in $\delta$13C between the soil, soil water (at 0–20 cm), throughfall, and litter leachate indicated that DOC is transformed in the surface soil and decreased the sensitivity indices of soil respiration of DOC flux to water flux, which suggests that soil respiration is more sensitive to the DOC flux in hydrological processes, especially the soil-water DOC flux, than to soil temperature or soil moisture.},

@article{Carey2001,
abstract = {Hillslope runoff was studied in a subarctic, subalpine environment to improve understanding of runoff generation processes and the mechanisms whereby water moves from hillslopes to the stream. Runoff characteristics of four hillslopes were examined between 1997 and 1999, each with distinct soils, frost, topography and vegetation. Lateral fluxes were confined to hillslopes with porous organic soils overlying less permeable mineral substrates, setting up a two-layer flow system whereby most drainage occurs as quickflow in the porous organic layer as matrix flow and/or as preferential flow in pipes, rills and interconnected surface depressions. During snowmelt, meltwater infiltrated and percolated the porous frozen organic layers with little resistance. Percolation ceased at the organic/mineral interface due to the impermeable nature of frozen mineral soils, forming a perched saturated zone and initiating runoff. Snowmelt runoff was greater on slopes with greater snow water equivalent and reduced organic layer thickness. In summer, runoff was greatest on slopes where wet conditions were sustained by inflow. Stormflow hydrographs responded rapidly to rainfall while exhibiting extended recessions compared with temperate regions. Where sustained inflow occurred, the recession limb showed two segments to reflect different source areas of stormflow production. Recession analysis was used to quantify contributing areas, which were highly variable and controlled largely by hillslope wetness and organic-layer properties. Results indicate that the concept of variable source area for runoff generation applies to subarctic, subalpine catchments.},

abstract = {Information on water quality, in particular on sediment, phosphorus and nitrogen exports from catchments, is required by catchment managers and other stakeholder groups to determine appropriate management options for water quality issues. However intensive spatial and temporal data on concentrations or loads of these nutrients is relatively scarce. Given this constraint, nutrient export models which can provide useful information on nutrient loads with only sparse data inputs are required. In addition, more complex physics and conceptually based models which are commonly available worldwide are often inappropriate for predicting loads in catchments. Consequently, models of a simpler conceptual and/or empirical type are used where input data are sparse and key processes are catchment dependent. This paper compares four such models (CMSS, AQUALM, Moss model and IHACRES-WQ) and several methods based on direct estimation for their ability to predict loads in Australian catchment situations. The implications of the limited available input data sets for load prediction in Australian catchments are discussed. In particular the importance of coordinated data collection over longer time periods and sufficiently fine temporal scales, covering a broad range of event sizes, is emphasised. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The River Continuum Concept (RCC) represents a synthesis of these ideas. Suggestions are made for clarifying, expanding, and refining the RCC to encompass broader spatial and temporal scales. Factors important in this regard include climate and geology, tributaries, location-specific lithology and geomorphology, and long-term changes imposed by man. It appears that most riverine ecosystems can be accommodated within this expanded conceptual framework and that the RCC continues to represent a useful paradigm for understanding and comparing the ecology of streams and rivers.},

abstract = {We investigated potential source areas of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in headwater streams by examining DOC concentrations in lysimeter, shallow well, and stream water samples from a ref- erence catchment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. These observations were then compared to high-frequency temporal variations in fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) at the catchment outlet and the predicted spatial extent of shallow groundwater in soils throughout the catchment. While near-stream soils are generally considered a DOC source in forested catchments, DOC concentrations in near-stream groundwater were low (mean52.4 mg/L, standard error50.6 mg/L), less than hillslope groundwater farther from the channel (mean55.7 mg/L, standard error50.4 mg/L). Furthermore, water tables in near-stream soils did not rise into the carbon-rich upper B or O horizons even during events. In contrast, soils below bedrock outcrops near channel heads where lateral soil formation processes dominate had much higher DOC concentrations. Soils immediately downslope of bedrock areas had thick eluvial hori- zons indicative of leaching of organic materials, Fe, and Al and had similarly high DOC concentrations in groundwater (mean514.5 mg/L, standard error50.8 mg/L). Flow from bedrock outcrops partially covered by organic soil horizons produced the highest groundwater DOC concentrations (mean520.0 mg/L, stand- ard error54.6 mg/L) measured in the catchment. Correspondingly, stream water in channel heads sourced in part by shallow soils and bedrock outcrops had the highest stream DOC concentrations measured in the catchment. Variation in FDOM concentrations at the catchment outlet followed water table fluctuations in shallow to bedrock soils near channel heads. We show that shallow hillslope soils receiving runoff from organic matter-covered bedrock outcrops may be a major source of DOC in headwater catchments in for- ested mountainous regions where catchments have exposed or shallow bedrock near channel heads.},

abstract = {Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are gaining traction as they offer mineralization potential rather than transferring contaminants between media. However, AOPs operated with limited energy and/or chemical inputs can exacerbate disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation, even as precursors such as dissolved organic carbon, UV254, and specific UV absorbance (SUVA) decrease. This study examined the relationship between DBP precursors and formation using TiO2 photocatalysis experiments, external AOP and non-AOP data, and predictive DBP models. The top-performing indicator, SUVA, generally correlated positively with trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, but limited-energy photocatalysis yielded contrasting negative correlations. The accuracy of predicted DBP values from models based on bulk parameters was generally poor, regardless of use and extent of AOP treatment and type of source water. Though performance improved for scenarios bounded by conditions used in model development, only 0.5{\%} of the model/dataset pairings satisfied all measured parameter boundary conditions, thereby introducing skepticism toward model usefulness. Study findings suggest that caution should be employed when using bulk indicators and/or models as a metric for AOP mitigation of DBP formation potential, particularly for limited-energy/chemical inputs.},

abstract = {Accurate quantification of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface and soil pore waters is crucial for understanding changes in water resources under the influence of climate and land use changes. Sampling and laboratory analysis of DOC content at a sufficient temporal frequency are especially difficult to achieve for natural DOC sources like the extensive boreal and arctic mire landscapes due to their remoteness. Therefore, the goals of this paper are (1) to investigate the performance of a portable, high-resolution ultraviolet-visible light spectroscopic method for determining the DOC content of surface and soil pore water samples from a boreal mire complex and (2) to compare the spectroscopic method with other DOC measurement techniques, e.g., the wet heated persulfate oxidation method and a laboratory, expulsion-based spectrophotometric method and (3) to assess different multivariate models that relate absorbance measurements with DOC contents. The study indicates that high-resolution spectroscopic measurements provide a simple, robust and non-destructive method for measuring DOC content. These measurements are of short duration ({\&}{\#}60;1. min) and the sample analysis is portable, rendering this method particularly advantageous for in situ investigations at remote field locations. The study also demonstrates that if absorbances at specific wavelengths are used as proxies for DOC concentration, it is recommended to create site-specific calibration models that include more than one wavelength to achieve the optimal accuracy of the proxy-based DOC quantification.},

abstract = {1.Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a central role in the dynamics of stream and river ecosystems, affecting processes such as metabolism, the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy, acidity, nutrient uptake and bioavailability of toxic compounds. However, despite its importance to stream processes, restoration and management activities rarely incorporate DOC as a major management criterion. 2.Lotic DOC pools reflect terrestrial organic carbon accumulation, transfer to the river channel and aquatic processing. In pristine landscapes, characteristics such as topography, climate, and landscape composition are strong predictors of terrestrial accumulation and transfer. Within aquatic systems, the quantity and form of DOC are altered by a variety of processes including primary production, microbial breakdown, sorption to particles and photodegradation. 3.Terrestrial accumulation, transfer and aquatic processing of DOC in agricultural and other human-dominated landscapes are all subject to substantial change. Consequently, DOC pools in agricultural streams likely differ from historic conditions and now include more labile material and low concentrations of a variety of ubiquitous synthetic organic compounds (e.g. pesticides, antibiotics). 4.Although DOC change in agricultural streams and associated ecological consequences are expected to be widespread, current understanding and relevant data needed to manage affected systems are surprisingly scarce. 5.Wetland and riparian restoration projects have variable effects on fluvial DOC regimes, but management at this intermediate scale is a realistic compromise between the small extent of most restoration projects and the large spatial scale over which organic carbon impairment occurs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Six methods were compared for calculating annual stream exports of sulfate, nitrate, calcium, magnesium and aluminum from six small Appalachian watersheds. Approximately 250-400 stream samples and concurrent stream flow measurements were collected during baseflows and storm flows for the 1989 water year at five Pennsylvania watersheds and during the 1989-1992 water years at a West Virginia watershed. Continuous stream flow records were also collected at each watershed. Solute exports were calculated from the complete data set using six different scenarios ranging from instantaneous monthly measurements of stream chemistry and stream flow, to intensive monitoring of storm flow events and multiple regression equations. The results for five of the methods were compared with the regression method because statistically significant models were developed and the regression equations allowed for prediction of solute concentrations during unsampled storm flows. Results indicated that continuous stream flow measurement was critical to producing exports within 10{\%} of regression estimates. For solutes whose concentrations were not correlated strongly with stream flow, weekly grab samples combined with continuous records of stream flow were sufficient to produce export estimates within 10{\%} of the regression method. For solutes whose concentrations were correlated strongly with stream flow, more intensive sampling during storm flows or the use of multiple regression equations were the most appropriate methods, especially for watersheds where stream flows changed most quickly. Concentration-stream flow relationships, stream hydrological response, available resources and required level of accuracy of chemical budgets should be considered when choosing a method for calculating solute exports. {\textcopyright} 1997 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Understanding how water and solutes enter and propagate through freshwater landscapes in the Anthropocene is critical to protecting and restoring aquatic ecosystems and ensuring human water security. However, high hydrochemical variability in headwater streams, where most carbon and nutrients enter river networks, has hindered effective modelling and management. We developed an analytical framework informed by landscape ecology and catchment hydrology to quantify spatiotemporal variability across scales, which we tested in 56 headwater catchments, sampled periodically over 12 years in western France. Unexpectedly, temporal variability in dissolved carbon, nutrients and major ions was preserved moving downstream and spatial patterns of water chemistry were stable on annual to decadal timescales, partly because of synchronous variation in solute concentrations. These findings suggest that while concentration and flux cannot be extrapolated among subcatchments, periodic sampling of headwaters provides valuable information about solute sources and subcatchment resilience to disturbance.},

abstract = {There is a lack of knowledge about how to quantify runoff generation and the hydrological processes operating in permafrost catchments on semi-arid plateaus. To understand how freeze-thaw cycles affect runoff generation processes in permafrost catchments, a typical headwater catchment with continuous permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau was measured. A new approach is presented in this study to account for runoff processes on the spring thawing period and autumn freezing period, when runoff generation clearly differs from that of non-permafrost catchments. This approach introduces a soil temperature-based water saturation function and modifies the soil water storage curve with a soil temperature threshold. The results show that surface soil thawing induced saturation excess runoff and subsurface interflow account for approximately 66–86{\%} and 14–34{\%} of total spring runoff, respectively, and the soil temperature significantly affects the runoff generation pattern, the runoff composition and the runoff coefficient with the enlargement of the active layer. The suprapermafrost groundwater discharge decreases exponentially with active layer frozen processes during autumn runoff recession, whereas the ratio of groundwater discharge to total runoff and the direct surface runoff coefficient simultaneously increase. The bidirectional freezing of the active layer controls and changes the autumn runoff processes and runoff composition. The new approach could be used to further develop hydrological models of cold regions dominated by permafrost.},

@phdthesis{Mistick2019,
abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important to ecosystem functioning and of high interest to drinking water treatment processes as it is costly to remove from source water. The effects of land use change (e.g. forest harvest) on DOC are not fully understood. Past studies of the effects of forestry on DOC have found mixed results, and covariate effects complicate mechanistic understanding and may underlie regional differences. DOC is typically highest during storm events, and detailed time-resolved measurements of DOC over longer periods are just becoming feasible with advances in in situ sensors. In this thesis, I investigated DOC concentration and character for headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest history in the UBC Malcolm Knapp Research Forest near Maple Ridge, British Columbia, and discussed implications for water treatment through expert interviews with water treatment engineers at Metro Vancouver. I took a two-pronged approach to the field study by measuring not only temporally detailed DOC concentration at two contrasting sites, but also spatially broad DOC concentration and character at 24 sites for six time points during the same study period. From the temporal analysis, I found base flow DOC concentration to be lower in the clear cut stream (Clear cut: 2.26 ± 0.43 mg/L; Forested: 4.30 ± 0.83 mg/L), but storm response to be stronger (mean increase DOC: Clear cut: 2.42 mg/L, Forested: 1.99 mg/L). Decreased DOC concentration after cutting may be due to reductions in carbon inputs like leaf litter, though differences in drainage area and the presence of a bog lake may also account for some of the observed difference. Elevated storm responses may be due to changes in flow paths related to forest harvesting. From the broad sampling analysis, I found differences in DOC character between the two land use types: DOC in clear cut sites was more protein-like whereas DOC in forested sites it was more humic-like, although once random factors were taken into account in generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), the relationship was no longer significant. Using categorization and regression tree (CART) modeling, I found drainage area to be the most important covariate related to DOC followed by time of year (i.e. seasonality).},

abstract = {Despite an increasing recognition of the importance of extreme rainfall events for organic carbon export to inland waters, little attention has been paid to the export and reactivity of particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) in mountainous headwater watersheds under monsoon climates. To investigate environmental implications of storm-enhanced export of POC and DOC in mountainous headwater streams, we examined the relationships between storm magnitude and C export from a forested watershed in the Haean Basin, South Korea, during 13 storm events over 4 years and compared potentials of DOC and POC for biodegradation and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation during an extreme rainfall event with a total rainfall of 209 mm. Event mean concentrations and export of POC increased nonlinearly above thresholds of precipitation and discharge, far exceeding the relatively small increases of DOC. The export of POC during a few storm events with a total rainfall above 200 mm per event exceeded the annual organic C export during dry years. During the 209 mm storm event, concentrations of total trihalomethanes formed by POC-derived dissolved components changed synchronously with POC concentrations, exhibiting lower levels than those formed by DOC. During a 30-day incubation at 25 degrees C, DOC exported during peak flow exhibited rapid biodegradation of labile components within 7 days. In contrast, the concentrations of DOC leached from POC gradually increased following the initial decline. Gradual transformation of POC-derived dissolved materials resulted in greater increases in the intensity of fulvic-and humic-like fluorescent components compared to the DOC treatment. The results highlight the significance of extreme rainfall events as "hot moments" for POC export from mountainous watersheds and also suggest that storm pulses of POC can provide potential sources of reactive organic components that can rapidly biodegrade and form DBPs after being released into headwater streams.},

abstract = {C cycling and dissolved organic C (DOC) inputs to boreal aquatic systems probably will change substantially with climate change. DOC concentrations already are increasing in surface waters. Terrestrial C is a major source of C to boreal freshwater ecosystems, but the interface between these 2 ecosystems, the riparian zone, has not been studied often. To improve our understanding of the importance of terrestrial inputs of DOC to aquatic systems from surrounding forests, we followed the changes of DOC concentration along a continuum of precipitation, throughfall, soil water, ground water, lake, and brook water in a pristine, boreal, forested headwater catchment and developed a lake C balance based on terrestrial and lacustrine C fluxes. We also examined DOC quality changes using the ratio of absorbance at 465 and 665 nm (E4/E6). DOC concentrations increased from 2.4 mg/L in precipitation to 132.3 mg/L in soil water as water passed through the terrestrial ecosystem. DOC concentrations in the riparian zone were correlated with DOC concentrations in the adjacent outflowing brook but not in the headwater lake. E4/E6 ratios indicated that the DOC in precipitation and throughfall was dominated by higher molecular weight compounds and that the DOC in soil and ground water was dominated by lower molecular weight compounds. The input of terrestrial DOC to the aquatic ecosystem was estimated to be 5 to 13 g C m-2 y-1, which is small compared with the C fluxes between atmosphere and vegetation, but can significantly decrease the net ecosystem exchange of an old-growth forest catchment. Terrestrial DOC was a major source of C in the lake, rendering it heterotrophic. The DOC export (3 g DOC m-2 y-1) made up almost 70{\%} of total C export.},

Stream waters with similar dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in different climatic regions had distinctive DOM compositions, but shared 69.5 {\%} of the 3286 individual chemical formulae detected. DOM compositions common to all watersheds were characterized by abundant lignin-like and tannin-like molecules as well as carboxyl-rich alicyclic-like molecules (CRAM); 50 {\%} of all formulae were found in all streams. Of the roughly 700 unique chemical formulae within a given fluvial network, most were outside the CRAM region within a van Krevelen diagram and 78 to 95 {\%} were restricted to 1st-order streams where diffuse ground water sources surface, coalesce into a channel, and flow downstream.

While multimetric indices have been used to show community composition, pollution tolerance, species diversity, and trophic structure with a combined index, the specific environmental factors that drive biological communities may be better explained through the use of multivariate statistical techniques. Macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages were sampled along with water quality, landuse and qualitative and quantitative habitat assessments from forty-nine sites throughout the Choctawhatchee-Pea, a southeastern U.S. watershed. Multivariate statistical analyses of habitat, water quality, and land-use data were used to determine the relationship between environmental variables and the dependent biological variables, macroinvertebrate and fish community structure. Sampling of biological and environmental data showed that there was a great deal of homogeneity within the watershed, which complicated the task of identifying environmental influences on biological assemblages. Macro-invertebrate and fish assemblages of the Choctawhatchee-Pea watershed were similar in their response to environmental conditions with water chemistry having the greatest relationship to macro-invertebrate and fish community structure followed by instream habitat and land use.

abstract = {Water quality studies require field data for assessment and mathematical simulation. Manual collection of water samples during floodsin small rivers is very difficult due to the short event duration and quick response to rainfall. Some low cost siphon samplers presented in the literature have been developed and adapted to collect event-based samples, but they only collect samples when the stream stage is rising. This work presents a new design of a low cost siphon sampler developed to allow collection when the stream stage is decreasing. It was tested in the laboratory and also installed in a river with flood flows strongly dominated by urban runoff. The major problem faced inthe field work was to keep the samplers in place due to the amount of debris carried by the floods. Laboratory tests showed water intrusion into the sampler during the rising stage and further improvement is proposed to solve the problem. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 IAHS Press.},

Waters from four different sources (two rivers and two lakes) were subjected to jar testing followed by 24hr disinfection by-product formation tests using chlorine. NOM was quantified using three common measures: dissolved organic carbon, ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm, and specific ultraviolet absorbance as well as by principal component analysis, peak picking, and parallel factor analysis of fluorescence spectra. Based on multi-linear modeling of THMs and HAAs, principle component (PC) scores resulted in the lowest mean squared prediction error of cross-folded test sets (THMs: 43.7 (??g/L)2, HAAs: 233.3 (??g/L)2). Inclusion of principle components representative of protein-like material significantly decreased prediction error for both THMs and HAAs. Parallel factor analysis did not identify a protein-like component and resulted in prediction errors similar to traditional NOM surrogates as well as fluorescence peak picking. These results support the value of fluorescence excitation-emission matrix-principal component analysis as a suitable NOM indicator in predicting the formation of THMs and HAAs for the water sources studied.},

abstract = {While the influence of antecedent conditions on watershed function is widely recognized under typical hydrologic regimes, gaps remain in the context of extreme climate events (ECEs). ECEs are those events that far exceed seasonal norms of intensity, duration, or impact upon the physical environment or ecosystem. In this synthesis, we discuss the role of source availability and hydrologic connectivity on antecedent conditions and propose a conceptual framework to characterize system response to ECEs at the watershed scale. We present four case studies in detail that span a range of types of antecedent conditions and type of ECE to highlight important controls and feedbacks. Because ECEs have the potential to export large amounts of water and materials, their occurrence in sequence can disproportionately amplify the response. In fact, multiple events may not be considered extreme in isolation, but when they occur in close sequence they may lead to extreme responses in terms of both supply and transport capacity. Therefore, to advance our understanding of these complexities, we need continued development of a mechanistic understanding of how antecedent conditions set the stage for ECE response across multiple regions and climates, particularly since monitoring of these rare events is costly and difficult to obtain. Through focused monitoring of critical ecosystems during rare events we will also be able to extend and validate modeling studies. Cross-regional comparisons are also needed to define characteristics of resilient systems. These monitoring, modeling, and synthesis efforts are more critical than ever in light of changing climate regimes, intensification of human modifications of the landscape, and the disproportionate impact of ECEs in highly populated regions.},

abstract = {From headwaters to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a con-tinuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream conununities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjust-ments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a frame-work for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implica-tions of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are},

abstract = {While much of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within rivers is destined for mineralization to CO2, a substantial fraction of riverine bicarbonate (HCO3−) flux represents a CO2 sink, as a result of weathering processes that sequester CO2 as HCO3−. We explored landscape-level controls on DOC and HCO3− flux in subcatchments of the boreal, with a specific focus on the effect of permafrost on riverine dissolved C flux. To do this, we undertook a multivariate analysis that partitioned the variance attributable to known, key regulators of dissolved C flux (runoff, lithology, and vegetation) prior to examining the effect of permafrost, using riverine biogeochemistry data from a suite of subcatchments drawn from the Mackenzie, Yukon, East, and West Siberian regions of the circumboreal. Across the diverse catchments that we study, controls on HCO3−flux were near-universal: runoff and an increased carbonate rock contribution to weathering (assessed as riverwater Ca:Na) increased HCO3− yields, while increasing permafrost extent was associated with decreases in HCO3−. In contrast, permafrost had contrasting and region-specific effects on DOC yield, even after the variation caused by other key drivers of its flux had been accounted for. We used ionic ratios and SO4 yields to calculate the potential range of CO2sequestered via weathering across these boreal subcatchments, and show that decreasing permafrost extent is associated with increases in weathering-mediated CO2 fixation across broad spatial scales, an effect that could counterbalance some of the organic C mineralization that is predicted with declining permafrost.},

abstract = {Hydrological events, driven by rainfall, control the amount and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) mobilized through river networks. In forested watersheds, the concentration, composition, and reactivity of DOM exported changes as baseflow transitions to storm flow, with major implications to downstream biogeochemistry. Hysteresis describes an observed difference between in-stream solute concentration/signal and discharge. By studying the relationship between DOM and stream discharge, we refine our understanding of the environmental and hydrological factors that influence the quantity and quality of stream DOM. The main objective of this study was to track hysteretic changes in riverine DOM molecular composition during storm events. Samples were collected from nested sites within the Passumpsic River catchment (Vermont, USA), a tributary of the Connecticut River. High-resolution monitoring of fluorescent DOM (via in situ sensors) and automated collection of discrete samples captured short-term, hydrologically driven variations in DOM concentration and composition. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed an enrichment in aliphatic compounds at storm onset, while aromatic and polyphenolic compounds were more enriched at peak discharge. Molecular hysteresis patterns were similar across stream orders, indicating that fresh, terrigenous DOM is quickly shunted downstream, through the river network, during pulses of high discharge.},

abstract = {The flux of terrestrial C to rivers has increased relative to preindustrial levels, a fraction of which is aged dissolved organic C (DOC). In rivers, C is stored in sediments, exported to the ocean, or (bio)chemically processed and released as CO2. Disturbance changes land cover and hydrology, shifting potential sources and processing of DOC. To investigate the likely sources of aged DOC, we analyzed radiocarbon ages, chemical, and spectral properties of DOC and major ions from 19 rivers draining the coterminous U.S. and Arctic. DOC optics indicated that the majority is exported as aromatic, high molecular weight, modern molecules while aged DOC tended to consist of smaller, microbial degradation products. Aged DOC exports, observed regularly in arid basins and during base flow in arctic rivers, are associated with higher proportion of mineral weathering products, suggesting deeper flows paths. These patterns also indicate potential for production of microbial byproducts as DOC ages in soil and water with longer periods of time between production and transport. Thus, changes in hydrology associated with landscape alteration (e.g., tilling or shifting climates) that can result in deeper flow paths or longer residence times will likely lead to a greater proportion of aged carbon in riverine exports.},

abstract = {1.Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a central role in the dynamics of stream and river ecosystems, affecting processes such as metabolism, the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy, acidity, nutrient uptake and bioavailability of toxic compounds. However, despite its importance to stream processes, restoration and management activities rarely incorporate DOC as a major management criterion. 2.Lotic DOC pools reflect terrestrial organic carbon accumulation, transfer to the river channel and aquatic processing. In pristine landscapes, characteristics such as topography, climate, and landscape composition are strong predictors of terrestrial accumulation and transfer. Within aquatic systems, the quantity and form of DOC are altered by a variety of processes including primary production, microbial breakdown, sorption to particles and photodegradation. 3.Terrestrial accumulation, transfer and aquatic processing of DOC in agricultural and other human-dominated landscapes are all subject to substantial change. Consequently, DOC pools in agricultural streams likely differ from historic conditions and now include more labile material and low concentrations of a variety of ubiquitous synthetic organic compounds (e.g. pesticides, antibiotics). 4.Although DOC change in agricultural streams and associated ecological consequences are expected to be widespread, current understanding and relevant data needed to manage affected systems are surprisingly scarce. 5.Wetland and riparian restoration projects have variable effects on fluvial DOC regimes, but management at this intermediate scale is a realistic compromise between the small extent of most restoration projects and the large spatial scale over which organic carbon impairment occurs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The solution chemistry of forested streams primarily in western North America is explained by considering the major factors that influence this chemistry-geological weathering; atmospheric precipitation and climate; precipitation acidity; terrestrial biological processes; physical/chemical reactions in the soil; and physical, chemical, and biological processes within streams. Due to the complexity of all these processes and their varying importance for different chemicals, stream water chemistry has exhibited considerable geographic and temporal variation and is difficult to model accurately. The impacts of forest harvesting on stream water chemistry were reviewed by considering the effects of harvesting on each of the important factors controlling this chemistry, as well as other factors influencing these impacts - extent of the watershed harvested, presence of buffer strips between streams and harvested areas, nature of post-harvesting site preparation, revegetation rate following harvesting, pre-harvesting soil fertility, and soil buffering capacity. These effects have sometimes reinforced one another but have sometimes been counterbalancing or slight so that harvesting impacts on stream water chemistry have been highly variable. Eight major knowledge gaps were identified, two of which - a scarcity of detailed stream chemical budgets and knowledge of longitudinal variation in stream chemistry - relate to undisturbed streams, while the remainder relate to forest harvesting effects.},

The chemical compositions were characterized by Ca–HCO3 in the glacier snow zone, Mg–Ca–SO4–HCO3 in the alpine cold desert zone, Ca–Mg–HCO3 in the marsh meadow zone, Ca–Mg–HCO3 in the alpine shrub zone, and Na–Ca–SO4 in the mountain grassland zone.

The results showed that during the melting period Mafengou River water was recharged by glacier–snow melt water about 34{\%}, thawed frozen soil water in each of the landscape zones about 12{\%}, and groundwater about 54{\%}. This study suggested that Mafengou River water during the melting period was mainly recharged by glacier–snow melt water, groundwater and thawed frozen soil water.},

abstract = {This report focuses on one specific interaction: the role of forests, and particularly protected forests, in maintaining quality of drinking water for large cities. There are many reasons for this focus: many city dwellers already face a crisis of water quality, and contaminated water spreads a vast and largely unnecessary burden in terms of short and long-term health impacts including infant mortality, with knock-on effects on ability to work, industrial productivity and on already over-stretched health services. The poorest members of society, unable to afford sterilized or bottled water, suffer the greatest impacts. Similar problems affect the rural poor as well of course, and sometimes these can be even more severe. However, in a rapidly urbanizing world the scale of the problem facing cities is particularly acute.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in streams is important, yet few studies focus on DOC dynamics in Midwestern streams during storms. In this study, stream DOC dynamics during storms in two Midwestern watersheds with contrasting land uses, the change in character of stream DOC during storms, and the usability of DOC as a hydrologic tracer in artificially drained landscapes of the Midwest are investigated. Major cation/DOC concentrations, and DOC specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and fluorescence index (FI) were monitored at 2-4 h intervals during three spring storms. Although DOC is less aromatic in the mixed land use watershed than in the agricultural watershed, land use has little impact on stream DOC concentration during storms. For both watersheds, DOC concentration follows discharge, and SUVA and FI values indicate an increase in stream DOC aromaticity and lignin content during storms. The comparison of DOC/major cation flushing dynamics indicates that DOC is mainly exported via overland flow/macropore flow. In both watersheds, the increase in DOC concentration in the streams during storms corresponds to a shift in the source of DOC from DOC originating from mineral soil layers of the soil profile at baseflow, to DOC originating from surficial soil layers richer in aromatic substances and lignin during storms. Results also suggest that DOC, SUVA and FI could be used as hydrologic tracers in artificially drained landscapes of the Midwest. These results underscore the importance of sampling streams for DOC during high flow periods in order to understand the fate of DOC in streams. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

@article{Bond-Lamberty2010,
abstract = {Soil respiration, R(S), the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide (CO(2)) from the soil surface to the atmosphere, is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux. However, the dynamics of R(S) are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained. Ecosystem warming experiments, modelling analyses and fundamental biokinetics all suggest that R(S) should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R(S), inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure R(S) on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global R(S) values in the extant four-decade record of R(S) chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide R(S) observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R(S) record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO(2) measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961-1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in R(S). We estimate that the global R(S) in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 +/- 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) between 1989 and 2008, implying a global R(S) response to air temperature (Q(10)) of 1.5. An increasing global R(S) value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.},

abstract = {Drinking water purveyors are increasingly relying on land conservation and management to ensure the safety of the water that they provide to consumers. To cost-effectively implement any such landscape initiatives, resources must be targeted to the appropriate spatial scale to address quality impairments of concern in a cost-effective manner. Using data gathered from 40 Canadian rivers across four ecozones, we examined the spatial scales at which land use was most closely associated with drinking source water quality metrics. Exploratory linear mixed-effects models accounting for climatic, hydrological, and physiographic variation among sites suggested that different spatial areas of land-use influence drinking source water quality depending on the parameter and season investigated. Escherichia coli spatial variability was only associated with land use at a local (5-10 km) spatial scale. Turbidity measures exhibited a complex association with land use, suggesting that the land-use areas of greatest influence can range from a 1 km subcatchment to the entire watershed depending on the season. Total organic carbon concentrations were only associated with land use characterized at the entire watershed scale. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index was used to calculate a composite measure of seasonal drinking source water quality but did not provide additional information beyond the analyses of individual parameters. These results suggest that entire watershed management is required to safeguard drinking water sources with more focused efforts at targeted spatial scales to reduce specific risk parameters.

A method is presented for measuring sediment originating from a road segment for individual storm events and quantifying the delivery to streams. Site selection criteria are listed to describe the characteristics for efficient data collection and analysis. The method describes equipment used to quantify sediment transport—data loggers, a rain gage, a traffic counter, Parshall flumes with stilling wells, hydrostatic pressure transducers, and water pumping samplers—as well as variables associated with sediment production—road surfacing material, traffic intensity, gradient, age, construction method, and precipitation. A sampling protocol that worked well for the forest roads in southeast Alaska and can be adapted for use in other regions also is described. Examples of data collection and analysis are explained both for sites near the road and downstream sites for sediment delivery quantification. This method can be used to determine the downstream transport of sediment originating from roads and developing regression models or validating existing sediment models.},

Results showed that the surface soil intercepted 94.4 ± 1.2 {\%} of the annual litter leachate DOC flux and is a sink for DOC. The throughfall and litter leachate DOC fluxes amounted to 6.81 and 7.23 {\%} of the net ecosystem exchange respectively, indicating that the DOC flux through hydrological processes is an important component of the carbon budget, and may be an important link between hydrological processes and soil respiration in a tropical rainforest. Even the variability in soil respiration is more dependent on the hydrologically transported water than DOC flux insignificantly, soil temperature, and soil-water content (at 0–20 cm). The difference in $\delta$13C between the soil, soil water (at 0–20 cm), throughfall, and litter leachate indicated that DOC is transformed in the surface soil and decreased the sensitivity indices of soil respiration of DOC flux to water flux, which suggests that soil respiration is more sensitive to the DOC flux in hydrological processes, especially the soil-water DOC flux, than to soil temperature or soil moisture.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The perhumid region of the coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) of Pacific North America is one of the wettest places on Earth and contains numerous small catchments that discharge freshwater and high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) directly to the coastal ocean. However, empirical data on the flux and composition of DOC exported from these watersheds are scarce. We established monitoring stations at the outlets of seven catchments on Calvert and Hecate islands, British Columbia, which represent the rain-dominated hypermaritime region of the perhumid CTR. Over several years, we measured stream discharge, stream water DOC concentration, and stream water dissolved organic-matter (DOM) composition. Discharge and DOC concentrations were used to calculate DOC fluxes and yields, and DOM composition was characterized using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The areal estimate of annual DOC yield in water year 2015 was 33.3 Mg C km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, with individual watersheds ranging from an average of 24.1 to 37.7 Mg C km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. This represents some of the highest DOC yields to be measured at the coastal margin. We observed seasonality in the quantity and composition of exports, with the majority of DOC export occurring during the extended wet period (September–April). Stream flow from catchments reacted quickly to rain inputs, resulting in rapid export of relatively fresh, highly terrestrial-like DOM. DOC concentration and measures of DOM composition were related to stream discharge and stream temperature and correlated with watershed attributes, including the extent of lakes and wetlands, and the thickness of organic and mineral soil horizons. Our discovery of high DOC yields from these small catchments in the CTR is especially compelling as they deliver relatively fresh, highly terrestrial organic matter directly to the coastal ocean. Hypermaritime landscapes are common on the British Columbia coast, suggesting that this coastal margin may play an important role in the regional processing of carbon and in linking terrestrial carbon to marine ecosystems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Variation in water chemistry was studied in 80 lakes in southern Sweden. The lakes had forest dominated catchments. The length of the time series was 14 years. Synchrony was calculated as Pearson's product moment correlation coefficients for all combinations of lakes, i.e. 3160 lake-pairs. The chemical variables studied were non-marine sulphate (SO4*), non-marine calcium (Ca*), absorbance and acid neutralising capacity (ANC). Statistically significant synchrony occurred in 93{\%} of all lake-pairs for SO4*, and between 58 and 67{\%} for absorbance, Ca* and ANC. In 70{\%} of all lake-pairs, the synchrony was {\textgreater} 0.71 for SO4*, which means that more than half of the variation in one lake could be explained by the variation in the other lake. For absorbance, Ca* and ANC, about 25{\%} of the lake-pairs had a synchrony {\textgreater} 0.71. The relatively high synchrony for SO4* occurred during an overall downward trend in SO4* concentration. The degree of synchrony in our study was at a level co mparable to other studies in northern America and England. However, our study included lakes in a much larger area, with distances of up to 500 km between the lakes, while earlier studies were made on small lake districts with lakes located within approximately 50 km. In contrast to these earlier studies, there was no correlation between synchrony and distance, lake characteristics or catchment characteristics. However, when a small subset of 15 lakes in the southeast of Sweden was selected, such relations were found. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

abstract = {Fluoroscopy, or real-time projection X-ray imaging, has been in clinical use since shortly after Roentgen's discovery of X-rays. Early fluoroscopes consisted simply of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which the patient was placed. After passing through the patient, the remnant beam impinged upon the fluorescent screen and produced a visible glow, which was directly observed by the practitioner. In modern systems, the fluorescent screen is coupled to an electronic device that amplifies and transforms the glowing light into a video signal suitable for presentation on an electronic display. One benefit of the modern system compared to the earlier approach is that the fluoroscopist need not stand in close proximity to the fluorescent screen in order to observe the live image. This results in a substantial reduction in radiation dose to the fluoroscopist. Patients receive less radiation dose as well, because of the amplification and overall efficiency of the imaging system. Fluoroscopy differs from most other X-ray imaging in that the images produced appear in real-time, allowing evaluation of dynamic biological processes and guiding interventions. Electronic fluoroscopy systems create this perception by capturing and displaying images at a high frame rate, typically 25 or 30 frames per second. At these frame rates, the human visual system cannot distinguish frame-to-frame variation and motion appears to be continuous, without visible flicker. To achieve high frame rates while keeping cumulative radiation dose to a reasonable level, the radiation dose to the image receptor per image (i.e., per frame) must be kept quite low, about 0.1{\%} of the dose used in radiography. Fluoroscopic images appear with an inverted grayscale (black/white is reversed) compared with standard radiographs. This convention is derivative of the appearance of the early non-intensified fluoroscopic screens, and it has been retained in the digital age even though the capability now exists to digitally reverse the grayscale.},

abstract = {[1] Quality concerns drive many water studies and practices, but obtaining samples from water bodies over time and space for quality determination is often difficult and expensive. We present a low-cost approach that allows integration of water samples over timescales of days to months to allow more widely distributed acquisition of time-integrated samples than possible with previous technology. The device is simply a submerged bottle with a small hole in the lid. In an alternative design the submerged bottle is connected by a tube to a second bottle located outside of the water. In either case, pressure changes inside the sampler arising from natural fluctuations in temperature and atmospheric pressure lead to an accumulation of water in the bottle. For example, when the sampler warms, air escapes the hole, and when it cools, water enters the hole, so with daily variation of 6°C per day the bottle will half fill in 1 month. Laboratory and environmental tests confirm the concept's function. Variants of the design for well sampling and use in deep water are also presented.

The results showed that AlD, CuD, and ZnD were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) higher in stormflow events than in baseflow, while in SS, all metal concentrations decreased (p {\textless} 0.05) during stormflow events. The metal seasonal variability was also examined. In dissolved form, only FeD showed significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) between seasons, with higher concentrations in summer, independently of the hydrological conditions, while in SS, only CuSS during stormflow events showed concentrations significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.05) during summer than in the remainder seasons. The partition coefficients (K D) decreased significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) for all metals during stormflow events. K D correlations showed that SS and DOC were the main factors in controlling the K D of all metals, except the K D of Mn which did not depend on any of these variables in baseflow. Metal enrichment factors were significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.05) during baseflow than in events which were associated to SS source and size. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {1. Landscape characteristics of sixty-two subcatchments within the Saginaw Bay Catchment of central Michigan were examined to identify relationships with stream water chemistry. Land use, land cover and elevation were quantified for both entire catchments and the upland-river ecotone (100 m stream buffer strip). Catchment and ecotone data were then empirically compared with stream water chemistry using multivariate and regression analyses. Redundancy analysis was used to partition variance among land use, geology, and the shared influence of land use and geology. 2. Major catchments dominated by rowcrop agriculture had the highest alkalinity, total dissolved solids and nitrate + nitrite concentrations. 3. Strong seasonal differences were observed in total nitrogen and nitrite + nitrate, but not in total phosphorus or suspended solids. Land use and landscape structure factors such as slope and patch density (number of land use patches per km2) accounted for most of the observed variance in summer. 4. In both autumn and summer, landscape factors accounted for much of the observed variation in total dissolved solids and alkalinity. During autumn, geological factors and the shared influence of geology/landscape structure plus land use exerted more influence than did land use alone. 5. Total phosphorus and total suspended solids were much better explained by land use within the stream ecotone in summer than in other seasons. However, total nitrogen, nitrate, orthophosphate and alkalinity were equally well explained by land use within the ecotone and throughout the whole catchment. Only total dissolved solids in summer and ammonium in autumn were explained better by the whole catchment than the ecotone. 6. Our results show that relatively coarse spatial databases can provide useful descriptors of regional water quality.},

abstract = {A rapid and effective detection method is essential for water utilities to monitor variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in source waters in order to apply strategies to minimize formation of disinfection by-products in treated waters. Ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UVA254) and specific UVA254 (SUVA254) have been widely used as surrogates of concentration and reactivity of DOC, respectively. However, poor correlations between SUVA254 and specific trihalomethane formation potential (STHMFP) have been occasionally reported and the reliability of using SUVA 254 to predict trihalomethane (THM) formation has been questioned. In this study, the correlations of SUVA254 and THM reactivity of three different DOC sources commonly found in water treatment facilities (aquatic carbon, soil carbon, and fecal matter) were evaluated. A 0.22 $\mu$m filter, instead of 0.45 $\mu$m filter, was used for water filtration to minimize the effects of colloidal materials on UVA254. UVA254 and DOC after chlorination were also examined and differential UVA254 and SUVA254 ($\Delta$SUVA254) were compared to THM reactivity. Results showed correlations between UVA254 and DOC were source dependent suggesting natural humification and degradation processes did not alter DOC characteristics from its original sources. The STHMFP of river and soil DOC samples were comparable, whereas their UVA254 normalized THMFP were different (p {\textless} 0.05), suggesting that UVA254 is a better indicator in predicting THM formation potential than DOC concentrations. $\Delta$SUVA254 showed a stronger correlation with STHMFP than the conventional surrogate - SUVA254. {\textcopyright} IWA Publishing 2008.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes in high-latitude inland waters. A critical question for understanding contemporary and future responses to environmental change is how the spatio-temporal dynamics of runoff generation processes will be affected. We sampled stable water isotopes in soils, lakes and rivers on an unprecedented spatio-temporal scale along a 1700 km transect over three years in the Western Siberia Lowlands. Our findings suggest that snowmelt mixes with, and displaces, large volumes of water stored in the organic soils and lakes to generate runoff during the thaw season. Furthermore, we saw a persistent hydrological connection between water bodies and the landscape across permafrost regions. Our findings help to bridge the understanding between small and large scale hydrological studies in high-latitude systems. These isotope data provide a means to conceptualise hydrological connectivity in permafrost and wetland influenced regions, which is needed for an improved understanding of future biogeochemical changes.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first of two physically-based modifications to a widely-used and well-validated hydrologic precipitation–runoff model. Here, we modify the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model to include a physically-based representation of the effects of freezing and thawing soil on the runoff generation process. This model is called the SAC-SMA Heat Transfer model (SAC-HT). The frozen ground physics are taken from the Noah land surface model which serves as the land surface component of several National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) numerical weather prediction models. SAC-HT requires a boundary condition of the soil temperature at the bottom of the soil column (a climatic annual air temperature is typically used, and parameters derived from readily available soil texture data). A noteworthy feature of SAC-HT is that the frozen ground component needs no parameter calibration. SAC-HT was tested at 11 sites in the U.S. for soil temperature, one site in Russia for soil temperature and soil moisture, eight basins in the upper Midwest for the effects of frozen-ground on streamflow, and one location for frost depth. High correlation coefficients for simulated soil temperature at three depths at 11 stations were achieved. Multi-year simulations of soil moisture and soil temperature agreed very well at the Valdai, Russia test location. In eight basins affected by seasonally frozen soil in the upper Midwest, SAC-HT provided improved streamflow simulations compared to SAC-SMA when both models used a priori parameters. Further improvement was gained through calibration of the non-frozen ground a priori parameters. Frost depth computed by SAC-HT compared well with observed values in the Root River basin in Minnesota.},

abstract = {We compared stream ecosystem responses to two types of disturbances: flood and debris flows. A large storm in February 1996 disturbed four similarly sized sub-watersheds of the Calapooia River, in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA. All sub-watersheds had flood and in two, 31 and 81{\%} of the perennial channel, a debris flow affected the channel. For 8 years, we used a suite of approaches: stream temperature, nutrient regime, periphyton and macroinvertebrate assemblages, and resident trout abundance and habitat to evaluate the persistence of instream impacts. Differences in stream temperatures and nitrate- nitrogen concentrations were evident, probably, due to the removal of vegetation and modification of riparian soils at the debris flow sites. Instream biological responses varied. After the event, fish, including trout, were rare with no fish at the debris flow sites. Within 6 years, trout densities (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Oncorhynchus clarki) were similar and young-of-the-year trouts were common. In contrast, periphyton and macroinvertebrate assemblages differed. Periphyton biomass was lower and nitrogen-fixing periphyton was more abundant at the debris flow sites. Macroinvertebrate assemblage diversity was higher at the debris flow sites due to fewer dominant taxa. Macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups also differed with fewer gatherers and more scrapers at the debris flow sites. Debris flow impacts related to loss of riparian canopy will probably persist until mature red alder stands are re-established along stream-reaches affected by debris flows to provide nitrogen input and shade.},

abstract = {Although the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) through freshwaters is nearly equivalent to the net carbon uptake of all terrestrial ecosystems, uncertainty remains about how source processes (carbon production and location) and transport processes (hydrologic connectivity and routing) interact to determine DOC flux across flow conditions and ecoregions. This limits our ability to predict the fluvial carbon flux responses to changes in climate and land use. We used DOC concentration and discharge patterns with ensemble modeling techniques to quantify DOC flux behavior for 1,006 U.S. watersheds spanning diverse climate and land cover conditions. We found that DOC flux was transport-limited (concentration increased with discharge) in 80{\%} of watersheds and that this flux behavior spanned ecoregions and watershed sizes. The generality of transport limitation demonstrates how coupling discharge models with widely available watershed properties could allow DOC flux to be efficiently integrated into landscape and Earth system models.},

abstract = {As a result of global warming, the discharges from rivers in permafrost regions have varied significantly. However, its mechanism remains unclear. One of possible factors is active soil freeze-thaw cycle, which may influence surface runoff in the variation of permafrost water cycle processes. In this study, a typical permafrost watershed in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau was selected, its hydrological processes were monitored from 2004 to 2007, and the effects of the freezing and thawing depth of the soil active layer on runoff processes were assessed. The runoff modulus, runoff coefficient, direct runoff ratio, recession gradient and their seasonal variations were estimated and analyzed. The active soil dynamics and water budget were analyzed to prove the features of the surface runoff and the influences of active soil freeze-thaw processes. The primary factors influencing surface runoff processes during different seasons were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and statistical regression methods. The results showed that the high runoff coefficient and low direct runoff ratio were the main characteristics during the spring flood period (May-June) and during the autumn recession period (September). The runoff modulus and its year-to-year variability were the greatest in the summer flood period. The direct runoff ratio decreased from 0.43 in May to 0.29 in September, with the exception of the highest ratio, which occurred during the summer recession period (July). The active soil thawing in the upper layer of depth of 60 cm had contributed to increase in discharge, but the increase in thawing depth deeper than 60 cm led to a decrease in surface runoff and slowness in the recession process. Precipitation played a small role in the spring flood runoff and the autumn runoff. The soil active layer freeze-thaw variation, which affected seasonal soil water dynamic and water budget and reformed seasonal runoff characteristics, along with vegetation cover changes, is considered the potential major factor in control of the hydrological processes in the permafrost region. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To better understand the effect of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transported by hydrological processes (rainfall, throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water; 0–20 cm) on soil respiration in tropical rainforests, we detected the DOC flux in rainfall, throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water (0–20 cm), compared the seasonality of $\delta$13CDOC in each hydrological process, and $\delta$13C in leaves, litter, and surface soil, and analysed the throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water (0–20 cm) effect on soil respiration in a tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna, south-west China. Results showed that the surface soil intercepted 94.4 ± 1.2 {\%} of the annual litter leachate DOC flux and is a sink for DOC. The throughfall and litter leachate DOC fluxes amounted to 6.81 and 7.23 {\%} of the net ecosystem exchange respectively, indicating that the DOC flux through hydrological processes is an important component of the carbon budget, and may be an important link between hydrological processes and soil respiration in a tropical rainforest. Even the variability in soil respiration is more dependent on the hydrologically transported water than DOC flux insignificantly, soil temperature, and soil-water content (at 0–20 cm). The difference in $\delta$13C between the soil, soil water (at 0–20 cm), throughfall, and litter leachate indicated that DOC is transformed in the surface soil and decreased the sensitivity indices of soil respiration of DOC flux to water flux, which suggests that soil respiration is more sensitive to the DOC flux in hydrological processes, especially the soil-water DOC flux, than to soil temperature or soil moisture.},

Differences in stream temperatures and nitrate- nitrogen concentrations were evident, probably, due to the removal of vegetation and modification of riparian soils at the debris flow sites. Instream biological responses varied. After the event, fish, including trout, were rare with no fish at the debris flow sites. Within 6 years, trout densities (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Oncorhynchus clarki) were similar and young-of-the-year trouts were common. In contrast, periphyton and macroinvertebrate assemblages differed. Periphyton biomass was lower and nitrogen-fixing periphyton was more abundant at the debris flow sites. Macroinvertebrate assemblage diversity was higher at the debris flow sites due to fewer dominant taxa. Macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups also differed with fewer gatherers and more scrapers at the debris flow sites. Debris flow impacts related to loss of riparian canopy will probably persist until mature red alder stands are re-established along stream-reaches affected by debris flows to provide nitrogen input and shade.},

abstract = {Disinfection by-products (DBPs) are formed when disinfectants (chlorine, ozone, chlorine dioxide, or chloramines) react with naturally occurring organic matter, anthropogenic contaminants, bromide, and iodide during the production of drinking water. Here we review 30 years of research on the occurrence, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity of 85 DBPs, 11 of which are currently regulated by the U.S., and 74 of which are considered emerging DBPs due to their moderate occurrence levels and/or toxicological properties. These 74 include halonitromethanes, iodo-acids and other unregulated halo-acids, iodo-trihalomethanes (THMs), and other unregulated halomethanes, halofuranones (MX [3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone] and brominated MX DBPs), haloamides, haloacetonitriles, tribromopyrrole, aldehydes, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and other nitrosamines. Alternative disinfection practices result in drinking water from which extracted organic material is less mutagenic than extracts of chlorinated water. However, the levels of many emerging DBPs are increased by alternative disinfectants (primarily ozone or chloramines) compared to chlorination, and many emerging DBPs are more genotoxic than some of the regulated DBPs. Our analysis identified three categories of DBPs of particular interest. Category 1 contains eight DBPs with some or all of the toxicologic characteristics of human carcinogens: four regulated (bromodichloromethane, dichloroacetic acid, dibromoacetic acid, and bromate) and four unregulated DBPs (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, MX, and NDMA). Categories 2 and 3 contain 43 emerging DBPs that are present at moderate levels (sub- to low-$\mu$g/L): category 2 contains 29 of these that are genotoxic (including chloral hydrate and chloroacetaldehyde, which are also a rodent carcinogens); category 3 contains the remaining 14 for which little or no toxicological data are available. In general, the brominated DBPs are both more genotoxic and carcinogenic than are chlorinated compounds, and iodinated DBPs were the most genotoxic of all but have not been tested for carcinogenicity. There were toxicological data gaps for even some of the 11 regulated DBPs, as well as for most of the 74 emerging DBPs. A systematic assessment of DBPs for genotoxicity has been performed for ∼60 DBPs for DNA damage in mammalian cells and 16 for mutagenicity in Salmonella. A recent epidemiologic study found that much of the risk for bladder cancer associated with drinking water was associated with three factors: THM levels, showering/bathing/swimming (i.e., dermal/inhalation exposure), and genotype (having the GSTT1-1 gene). This finding, along with mechanistic studies, highlights the emerging importance of dermal/inhalation exposure to the THMs, or possibly other DBPs, and the role of genotype for risk for drinking-water-associated bladder cancer. More than 50{\%} of the total organic halogen (TOX) formed by chlorination and more than 50{\%} of the assimilable organic carbon (AOC) formed by ozonation has not been identified chemically. The potential interactions among the 600 identified DBPs in the complex mixture of drinking water to which we are exposed by various routes is not reflected in any of the toxicology studies of individual DBPs. The categories of DBPs described here, the identified data gaps, and the emerging role of dermal/inhalation exposure provide guidance for drinking water and public health research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The approach, which combines several randomized decision trees and aggregates their predictions by averaging, has shown excellent performance in settings where the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations. Moreover, it is versatile enough to be applied to large-scale problems, is easily adapted to various ad hoc learning tasks, and returns measures of variable importance. The present article reviews the most recent theoretical and methodological developments for random forests. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical forces driving the algorithm, with special attention given to the selection of parameters, the resampling mechanism, and variable importance measures. This review is intended to provide non-experts easy access to the main ideas.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The perhumid region of the coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) of Pacific North America is one of the wettest places on Earth and contains numerous small catchments that discharge freshwater and high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) directly to the coastal ocean. However, empirical data on the flux and composition of DOC exported from these watersheds are scarce. We established monitoring stations at the outlets of seven catchments on Calvert and Hecate islands, British Columbia, which represent the rain-dominated hypermaritime region of the perhumid CTR. Over several years, we measured stream discharge, stream water DOC concentration, and stream water dissolved organic-matter (DOM) composition. Discharge and DOC concentrations were used to calculate DOC fluxes and yields, and DOM composition was characterized using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The areal estimate of annual DOC yield in water year 2015 was 33.3 Mg C km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, with individual watersheds ranging from an average of 24.1 to 37.7 Mg C km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. This represents some of the highest DOC yields to be measured at the coastal margin. We observed seasonality in the quantity and composition of exports, with the majority of DOC export occurring during the extended wet period (September–April). Stream flow from catchments reacted quickly to rain inputs, resulting in rapid export of relatively fresh, highly terrestrial-like DOM. DOC concentration and measures of DOM composition were related to stream discharge and stream temperature and correlated with watershed attributes, including the extent of lakes and wetlands, and the thickness of organic and mineral soil horizons. Our discovery of high DOC yields from these small catchments in the CTR is especially compelling as they deliver relatively fresh, highly terrestrial organic matter directly to the coastal ocean. Hypermaritime landscapes are common on the British Columbia coast, suggesting that this coastal margin may play an important role in the regional processing of carbon and in linking terrestrial carbon to marine ecosystems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We measured DOM molecular composition across three stream orders in the headwaters of well characterized forested catchments with ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to assess DOM chemogeography and chemodiversity over the spatial scales of climatic regions and fluvial networks. Stream waters with similar dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in different climatic regions had distinctive DOM compositions, but shared 69.5 {\%} of the 3286 individual chemical formulae detected. DOM compositions common to all watersheds were characterized by abundant lignin-like and tannin-like molecules as well as carboxyl-rich alicyclic-like molecules (CRAM); 50 {\%} of all formulae were found in all streams. Of the roughly 700 unique chemical formulae within a given fluvial network, most were outside the CRAM region within a van Krevelen diagram and 78 to 95 {\%} were restricted to 1st-order streams where diffuse ground water sources surface, coalesce into a channel, and flow downstream. The 1st-order streams within a fluvial network also exhibited the highest formula diversity as well as the greatest numbers of formulae across a broad range of compound classes.},

This study compares the influence of land use and climate on DBP precursors in two catchments supplying the region around the City of Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada, and assesses the variability of Disinfection By-Product (DBP) concentration and speciation following rainfall events. DBPs (trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs)) and their precursors in raw waters (pH, turbidity, specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), total and dissolved organic carbon, bromides and chlorine dose) were monitored. Various experimental chlorination tests, DBP formation potential (DBPFP) and Simulated Distribution Systems (SDS), were also performed. Differences in pre-rainfall (baseflow) water quality were noted according to the different watershed land uses. Raw water quality patterns showed modifications between baseflow and rainfall periods, with a degradation of raw water quality according to turbidity and SUVA in both water sources. Rainfall events were also shown to alter organic matter reactivity with an increase in THM formation potential for both sites. A less noticeable impact on HAA formation potential was observed. However, no clear differences in DBPFP tests were observed between the sites. SDS tests showed that rainfall events lead to considerable rises in organic carbon reactivity of filtered waters, even after primary treatment, with a 2-fold increase in THM and HAA concentrations following rainfall for waters representing the end of one main distribution system (20 h contact time). These increases are linked mainly to a rise in non-brominated DBPs such as chloroform, trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid. This study confirms the importance of strictly controlling OM levels during drinking water treatment to ensure safe drinking water quality throughout the distribution system.},

abstract = {Online monitoring dissolved organic matter (DOM) is urgent for water treatment management. In this study, high performance size exclusion chromatography with multi-UV absorbance and multi-emission fluorescence scans were applied to spectrally characterize samples from 16 drinking water sources across Yangzi River and Huai River Watersheds. The UV absorbance indices at 254 nm and 280 nm referred to the same DOM components and concentration, and the 280 nm UV light could excite both protein-like and humic-like fluorescence. Hence a novel UV fluorescence sensor was developed out using only one UV280 light-emitting diode (LED) as light source. For all samples, enhanced coagulation was mainly effective for large molecular weight biopolymers; while anion exchange further substantially removed humic substances. During chlorination tests, UVA280 and UVA254 showed similar correlations with yields of disinfection byproducts (DBPs); the humic-like fluorescence obtained from LED sensors correlated well with both trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids yields, while the correlation between protein-like fluorescence and trihalomethanes was relatively poor. Anion exchange exhibited more reduction of DBPs yields as well as UV absorbance and fluorescence signals than enhanced coagulation. The results suggest that the LED UV fluorescence sensors are very promising for online monitoring DOM and predicting DBPs formation potential during water treatment.},

This limits our ability to predict the fluvial carbon flux responses to changes in climate and land use. We used DOC concentration and discharge patterns with ensemble modeling techniques to quantify DOC flux behavior for 1,006 U.S. watersheds spanning diverse climate and land cover conditions. We found that DOC flux was transport-limited (concentration increased with discharge) in 80{\%} of watersheds and that this flux behavior spanned ecoregions and watershed sizes. The generality of transport limitation demonstrates how coupling discharge models with widely available watershed properties could allow DOC flux to be efficiently integrated into landscape and Earth system models.},

Due to the complexity of all these processes and their varying importance for different chemicals, stream water chemistry has exhibited considerable geographic and temporal variation and is difficult to model accurately. The impacts of forest harvesting on stream water chemistry were reviewed by considering the effects of harvesting on each of the important factors controlling this chemistry, as well as other factors influencing these impacts - extent of the watershed harvested, presence of buffer strips between streams and harvested areas, nature of post-harvesting site preparation, revegetation rate following harvesting, pre-harvesting soil fertility, and soil buffering capacity. These effects have sometimes reinforced one another but have sometimes been counterbalancing or slight so that harvesting impacts on stream water chemistry have been highly variable. Eight major knowledge gaps were identified, two of which — a scarcity of detailed stream chemical budgets and knowledge of longitudinal variation in stream chemistry — relate to undisturbed streams, while the remainder relate to forest harvesting effects.},

Results showed that the surface soil intercepted 94.4 ± 1.2 {\%} of the annual litter leachate DOC flux and is a sink for DOC. The throughfall and litter leachate DOC fluxes amounted to 6.81 and 7.23 {\%} of the net ecosystem exchange respectively, indicating that the DOC flux through hydrological processes is an important component of the carbon budget, and may be an important link between hydrological processes and soil respiration in a tropical rainforest. Even the variability in soil respiration is more dependent on the hydrologically transported water than DOC flux insignificantly, soil temperature, and soil-water content (at 0–20 cm). The difference in $\delta$13C between the soil, soil water (at 0–20 cm), throughfall, and litter leachate indicated that DOC is transformed in the surface soil and decreased the sensitivity indices of soil respiration of DOC flux to water flux, which suggests that soil respiration is more sensitive to the DOC flux in hydrological processes, especially the soil-water DOC flux, than to soil temperature or soil moisture.},

abstract = {Forest fires occur with increasing frequency and severity in the western United States, potentially altering the chemistry and quantity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors exported from forested watersheds. However, little is known concerning effects of the fire triangle (heat, oxygen, and fuel) on DOM alteration. Using detritus from Pinus ponderosa and Abies concolor (dominant species in forests in the western United States), we prepared DOM from unburned and burned detritus under hypoxic (pyrolysis) and oxic conditions (thermal oxidation) at 250 and 400 °C. DOM characteristics and chlorine reactivity were evaluated by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and chlorination-based DBP formation potential tests. Spectroscopic results suggest that burned-detritus extracts had lower molecular weight (reflected by increased E2:E3 and fluorescence index) and divergent aromaticity (reflected by SUVA254) depending on oxygen availability.

abstract = {The random forest algorithm, proposed by L. Breiman in 2001, has been extremely successful as a general-purpose classification and regression method. The approach, which combines several randomized decision trees and aggregates their predictions by averaging, has shown excellent performance in settings where the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations. Moreover, it is versatile enough to be applied to large-scale problems, is easily adapted to various ad hoc learning tasks, and returns measures of variable importance. The present article reviews the most recent theoretical and methodological developments for random forests. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical forces driving the algorithm, with special attention given to the selection of parameters, the resampling mechanism, and variable importance measures. This review is intended to provide non-experts easy access to the main ideas.},

abstract = {We investigated potential source areas of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in headwater streams by examining DOC concentrations in lysimeter, shallow well, and stream water samples from a ref- erence catchment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. These observations were then compared to high-frequency temporal variations in fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) at the catchment outlet and the predicted spatial extent of shallow groundwater in soils throughout the catchment. While near-stream soils are generally considered a DOC source in forested catchments, DOC concentrations in near-stream groundwater were low (mean52.4 mg/L, standard error50.6 mg/L), less than hillslope groundwater farther from the channel (mean55.7 mg/L, standard error50.4 mg/L). Furthermore, water tables in near-stream soils did not rise into the carbon-rich upper B or O horizons even during events. In contrast, soils below bedrock outcrops near channel heads where lateral soil formation processes dominate had much higher DOC concentrations. Soils immediately downslope of bedrock areas had thick eluvial hori- zons indicative of leaching of organic materials, Fe, and Al and had similarly high DOC concentrations in groundwater (mean514.5 mg/L, standard error50.8 mg/L). Flow from bedrock outcrops partially covered by organic soil horizons produced the highest groundwater DOC concentrations (mean520.0 mg/L, stand- ard error54.6 mg/L) measured in the catchment. Correspondingly, stream water in channel heads sourced in part by shallow soils and bedrock outcrops had the highest stream DOC concentrations measured in the catchment. Variation in FDOM concentrations at the catchment outlet followed water table fluctuations in shallow to bedrock soils near channel heads. We show that shallow hillslope soils receiving runoff from organic matter-covered bedrock outcrops may be a major source of DOC in headwater catchments in for- ested mountainous regions where catchments have exposed or shallow bedrock near channel heads.},

abstract = {There is a growing awareness that mid-to-high latitude regions will be strongly affected by climate change. These changes are predicted to be especially pronounced during winter, particularly at higher latitudes. To test how water quality in northern catchments could be affected by warmer winter climates, we assembled long-term data from eight well-studied catchments in Sweden, Scotland, Canada and the USA across a climatic gradient spanning from -2 to +9°C in mean annual temperature and between -11.6 and +6.1°C in average winter temperature. We used the climatic gradient combined with inter-annual variability among catchments to examine how warmer winters could affect the seasonality (seasonal timing) and synchroneity (coupling) of water and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes. In general, sites with colder winters (less than -5°C) experienced an export concentrated in spring, whereas sites with warmer winters ({\textgreater}0°C) displayed a more evenly distributed export across all seasons. Catchments with warmer winters also displayed less synchroneity between water and DOC flux during winter compared with colder sites, whereas the opposite was found for the spring. Patterns from the climatic gradient were supported by inter-annual variability at individual sites where both seasonality and synchroneity in the spring were related to the temperature during the preceding winter. Our findings suggest that one likely consequence of warmer winters in northern regions is that the proportion of the annual DOC and water export will increase during winter and decrease during spring and summer. This is of importance as it is the latter seasons during which downstream utilization of both water and DOC often is largest. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Accurate quantification of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface and soil pore waters is crucial for understanding changes in water resources under the influence of climate and land use changes. Sampling and laboratory analysis of DOC content at a sufficient temporal frequency are especially difficult to achieve for natural DOC sources like the extensive boreal and arctic mire landscapes due to their remoteness. Therefore, the goals of this paper are (1) to investigate the performance of a portable, high-resolution ultraviolet-visible light spectroscopic method for determining the DOC content of surface and soil pore water samples from a boreal mire complex and (2) to compare the spectroscopic method with other DOC measurement techniques, e.g., the wet heated persulfate oxidation method and a laboratory, expulsion-based spectrophotometric method and (3) to assess different multivariate models that relate absorbance measurements with DOC contents. The study indicates that high-resolution spectroscopic measurements provide a simple, robust and non-destructive method for measuring DOC content. These measurements are of short duration ({\&}{\#}60;1. min) and the sample analysis is portable, rendering this method particularly advantageous for in situ investigations at remote field locations. The study also demonstrates that if absorbances at specific wavelengths are used as proxies for DOC concentration, it is recommended to create site-specific calibration models that include more than one wavelength to achieve the optimal accuracy of the proxy-based DOC quantification.},

A critical question for understanding contemporary and future responses to environmental change is how the spatio-temporal dynamics of runoff generation processes will be affected. We sampled stable water isotopes in soils, lakes and rivers on an unprecedented spatio-temporal scale along a 1700 km transect over three years in the Western Siberia Lowlands. Our findings suggest that snowmelt mixes with, and displaces, large volumes of water stored in the organic soils and lakes to generate runoff during the thaw season. Furthermore, we saw a persistent hydrological connection between water bodies and the landscape across permafrost regions. Our findings help to bridge the understanding between small and large scale hydrological studies in high-latitude systems. These isotope data provide a means to conceptualise hydrological connectivity in permafrost and wetland influenced regions, which is needed for an improved understanding of future biogeochemical changes.},

abstract = {Hillslope runoff was studied in a subarctic, subalpine environment to improve understanding of runoff generation processes and the mechanisms whereby water moves from hillslopes to the stream. Runoff characteristics of four hillslopes were examined between 1997 and 1999, each with distinct soils, frost, topography and vegetation. Lateral fluxes were confined to hillslopes with porous organic soils overlying less permeable mineral substrates, setting up a two-layer flow system whereby most drainage occurs as quickflow in the porous organic layer as matrix flow and/or as preferential flow in pipes, rills and interconnected surface depressions. During snowmelt, meltwater infiltrated and percolated the porous frozen organic layers with little resistance. Percolation ceased at the organic/mineral interface due to the impermeable nature of frozen mineral soils, forming a perched saturated zone and initiating runoff. Snowmelt runoff was greater on slopes with greater snow water equivalent and reduced organic layer thickness. In summer, runoff was greatest on slopes where wet conditions were sustained by inflow. Stormflow hydrographs responded rapidly to rainfall while exhibiting extended recessions compared with temperate regions. Where sustained inflow occurred, the recession limb showed two segments to reflect different source areas of stormflow production. Recession analysis was used to quantify contributing areas, which were highly variable and controlled largely by hillslope wetness and organic-layer properties. Results indicate that the concept of variable source area for runoff generation applies to subarctic, subalpine catchments.},

abstract = {Dynamics of river dissolved organic matter (DOM) during storm events have profound influences on the downstream aquatic ecosystem and drinking water safety. This study investigated temporal variations in DOM during four storm events in two forest headwater streams (the EH and JH brooks, South Korea) and the impacts on the disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formation potential. The within-event variations of most DOM quantity parameters were similar to the flow rate in the EH but not in the larger JH brook. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis with the flow rate in the EH and JH brooks, respectively, indicating the importance of both flow path and DOM source pool size in determining the effects of storm events. The stream DOM became less aromatic/humified from the first to the last event in both brooks, probably due to the increasing fresh plant pool and the decreasing leaf litter pool during the course of rainy season. The DOC export during each event increased 1.3-2.7- and 1.1-7.0-fold by stormflows in the EH and JH brooks, respectively. The leaf litter and soil together was the major DOM source, particularly during early events. The enhanced DOM export probably increases the risks of DBPs formation in disinfection, as indicated by a strong correlation observed between DOC and trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP). High correlations between two humic-like fluorescent components and THMFP further suggested the potential of assessing THMFP with in situ fluorescence sensors during storms.},

abstract = {While much of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within rivers is destined for mineralization to CO2, a substantial fraction of riverine bicarbonate (HCO3−) flux represents a CO2 sink, as a result of weathering processes that sequester CO2 as HCO3−. We explored landscape-level controls on DOC and HCO3− flux in subcatchments of the boreal, with a specific focus on the effect of permafrost on riverine dissolved C flux. To do this, we undertook a multivariate analysis that partitioned the variance attributable to known, key regulators of dissolved C flux (runoff, lithology, and vegetation) prior to examining the effect of permafrost, using riverine biogeochemistry data from a suite of subcatchments drawn from the Mackenzie, Yukon, East, and West Siberian regions of the circumboreal. Across the diverse catchments that we study, controls on HCO3−flux were near-universal: runoff and an increased carbonate rock contribution to weathering (assessed as riverwater Ca:Na) increased HCO3− yields, while increasing permafrost extent was associated with decreases in HCO3−. In contrast, permafrost had contrasting and region-specific effects on DOC yield, even after the variation caused by other key drivers of its flux had been accounted for. We used ionic ratios and SO4 yields to calculate the potential range of CO2sequestered via weathering across these boreal subcatchments, and show that decreasing permafrost extent is associated with increases in weathering-mediated CO2 fixation across broad spatial scales, an effect that could counterbalance some of the organic C mineralization that is predicted with declining permafrost.},

abstract = {River networks modify material transfer from land to ocean. Understanding the factors regulating this function for different gaseous, dissolved, and particulate constituents is critical to quantify the local and global effects of climate and land use change. We propose the River Network Saturation (RNS) concept as a generalization of how river network regulation of material fluxes declines with increasing flows due to imbalances between supply and demand at network scales. River networks have a tendency to become saturated (supply ≫ demand) under higher flow conditions because supplies increase faster than sink processes. However, the flow thresholds under which saturation occurs depends on a variety of factors, including the inherent process rate for a given constituent and the abundance of lentic waters such as lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and fluvial wetlands within the river network. As supply increases, saturation at network scales is initially limited by previously unmet demand in downstream aquatic ecosystems. The RNS concept describes a general tendency of river network function that can be used to compare the fate of different constituents among river networks. New approaches using nested in situ high-frequency sensors and spatially extensive synoptic techniques offer the potential to test the RNS concept in different settings. Better understanding of when and where river networks saturate for different constituents will allow for the extrapolation of aquatic function to broader spatial scales and therefore provide information on the influence of river function on continental element cycles and help identify policy priorities.},

Due to the complexity of all these processes and their varying importance for different chemicals, stream water chemistry has exhibited considerable geographic and temporal variation and is difficult to model accurately. The impacts of forest harvesting on stream water chemistry were reviewed by considering the effects of harvesting on each of the important factors controlling this chemistry, as well as other factors influencing these impacts - extent of the watershed harvested, presence of buffer strips between streams and harvested areas, nature of post-harvesting site preparation, revegetation rate following harvesting, pre-harvesting soil fertility, and soil buffering capacity. These effects have sometimes reinforced one another but have sometimes been counterbalancing or slight so that harvesting impacts on stream water chemistry have been highly variable. Eight major knowledge gaps were identified, two of which - a scarcity of detailed stream chemical budgets and knowledge of longitudinal variation in stream chemistry - relate to undisturbed streams, while the remainder relate to forest harvesting effects.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first of two physically-based modifications to a widely-used and well-validated hydrologic precipitation–runoff model. Here, we modify the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model to include a physically-based representation of the effects of freezing and thawing soil on the runoff generation process. This model is called the SAC-SMA Heat Transfer model (SAC-HT). The frozen ground physics are taken from the Noah land surface model which serves as the land surface component of several National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) numerical weather prediction models. SAC-HT requires a boundary condition of the soil temperature at the bottom of the soil column (a climatic annual air temperature is typically used, and parameters derived from readily available soil texture data). A noteworthy feature of SAC-HT is that the frozen ground component needs no parameter calibration. SAC-HT was tested at 11 sites in the U.S. for soil temperature, one site in Russia for soil temperature and soil moisture, eight basins in the upper Midwest for the effects of frozen-ground on streamflow, and one location for frost depth. High correlation coefficients for simulated soil temperature at three depths at 11 stations were achieved. Multi-year simulations of soil moisture and soil temperature agreed very well at the Valdai, Russia test location. In eight basins affected by seasonally frozen soil in the upper Midwest, SAC-HT provided improved streamflow simulations compared to SAC-SMA when both models used a priori parameters. Further improvement was gained through calibration of the non-frozen ground a priori parameters. Frost depth computed by SAC-HT compared well with observed values in the Root River basin in Minnesota.},

abstract = {Spring rainfall events can have deleterious impacts on raw and drinking water quality for water treatment plants that use surface waters. This study compares the influence of land use and climate on DBP precursors in two catchments supplying the region around the City of Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada, and assesses the variability of Disinfection By-Product (DBP) concentration and speciation following rainfall events. DBPs (trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs)) and their precursors in raw waters (pH, turbidity, specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), total and dissolved organic carbon, bromides and chlorine dose) were monitored. Various experimental chlorination tests, DBP formation potential (DBPFP) and Simulated Distribution Systems (SDS), were also performed. Differences in pre-rainfall (baseflow) water quality were noted according to the different watershed land uses. Raw water quality patterns showed modifications between baseflow and rainfall periods, with a degradation of raw water quality according to turbidity and SUVA in both water sources. Rainfall events were also shown to alter organic matter reactivity with an increase in THM formation potential for both sites. A less noticeable impact on HAA formation potential was observed. However, no clear differences in DBPFP tests were observed between the sites. SDS tests showed that rainfall events lead to considerable rises in organic carbon reactivity of filtered waters, even after primary treatment, with a 2-fold increase in THM and HAA concentrations following rainfall for waters representing the end of one main distribution system (20 h contact time). These increases are linked mainly to a rise in non-brominated DBPs such as chloroform, trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid. This study confirms the importance of strictly controlling OM levels during drinking water treatment to ensure safe drinking water quality throughout the distribution system.},

abstract = {A rapid and effective detection method is essential for water utilities to monitor variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in source waters in order to apply strategies to minimize formation of disinfection by-products in treated waters. Ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UVA254) and specific UVA254 (SUVA254) have been widely used as surrogates of concentration and reactivity of DOC, respectively. However, poor correlations between SUVA254 and specific trihalomethane formation potential (STHMFP) have been occasionally reported and the reliability of using SUVA 254 to predict trihalomethane (THM) formation has been questioned. In this study, the correlations of SUVA254 and THM reactivity of three different DOC sources commonly found in water treatment facilities (aquatic carbon, soil carbon, and fecal matter) were evaluated. A 0.22 $\mu$m filter, instead of 0.45 $\mu$m filter, was used for water filtration to minimize the effects of colloidal materials on UVA254. UVA254 and DOC after chlorination were also examined and differential UVA254 and SUVA254 ($\Delta$SUVA254) were compared to THM reactivity. Results showed correlations between UVA254 and DOC were source dependent suggesting natural humification and degradation processes did not alter DOC characteristics from its original sources. The STHMFP of river and soil DOC samples were comparable, whereas their UVA254 normalized THMFP were different (p {\textless} 0.05), suggesting that UVA254 is a better indicator in predicting THM formation potential than DOC concentrations. $\Delta$SUVA254 showed a stronger correlation with STHMFP than the conventional surrogate - SUVA254. {\textcopyright} IWA Publishing 2008.},

abstract = {[1] Quality concerns drive many water studies and practices, but obtaining samples from water bodies over time and space for quality determination is often difficult and expensive. We present a low-cost approach that allows integration of water samples over timescales of days to months to allow more widely distributed acquisition of time-integrated samples than possible with previous technology. The device is simply a submerged bottle with a small hole in the lid. In an alternative design the submerged bottle is connected by a tube to a second bottle located outside of the water. In either case, pressure changes inside the sampler arising from natural fluctuations in temperature and atmospheric pressure lead to an accumulation of water in the bottle. For example, when the sampler warms, air escapes the hole, and when it cools, water enters the hole, so with daily variation of 6°C per day the bottle will half fill in 1 month. Laboratory and environmental tests confirm the concept's function. Variants of the design for well sampling and use in deep water are also presented.

abstract = {Conventional water treatment processes (e.g., coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration) are widely used for producing drinking water from surface water sources. Transient, gradual, or abrupt changes in source water quality that could compromise treatment effectiveness can be triggered by climate and related meteorological events, accidental or intentional contamination, security breaches, or other disruptions. However, the design principles that underpin the majority of existing conventional treatment systems predate climate adaptation considerations. This paper considers the adaptation capacity of conventional water treatment systems. A modeling framework is used to illustrate climate adaptation mechanisms that could enable conventional treatment systems to accommodate water quality impairments. Treatment system resiliency is explored in response to generic climate-relevant water quality perturbations such as extreme temperature variations and changes in the quantity and characteristics of solids, particles, and organic constituents. Promising adaptation options include modifying chemical parameters (e.g., types of chemicals, dosages, sequence of chemical addition, mixing intensity and duration), filter operations, and microbiological augmentation of existing physical/chemical treatment systems. The capacity reserve concept provides an organizing principle that could be useful for prioritizing climate adaptation strategies such as major or minor treatment/infrastructure modifications, system-wide upgrades such as off-line storage, operational changes in distribution systems, or the use of supplemental water sources including reclaimed or recycled water.},

abstract = {The solution chemistry of forested streams primarily in western North America is explained by considering the major factors that influence this chemistry — geological weathering; atmospheric precipitation and climate; precipitation acidity; terrestrial biological processes; physical/chemical reactions in the soil; and physical, chemical, and biological processes within streams. Due to the complexity of all these processes and their varying importance for different chemicals, stream water chemistry has exhibited considerable geographic and temporal variation and is difficult to model accurately. The impacts of forest harvesting on stream water chemistry were reviewed by considering the effects of harvesting on each of the important factors controlling this chemistry, as well as other factors influencing these impacts - extent of the watershed harvested, presence of buffer strips between streams and harvested areas, nature of post-harvesting site preparation, revegetation rate following harvesting, pre-harvesting soil fertility, and soil buffering capacity. These effects have sometimes reinforced one another but have sometimes been counterbalancing or slight so that harvesting impacts on stream water chemistry have been highly variable. Eight major knowledge gaps were identified, two of which — a scarcity of detailed stream chemical budgets and knowledge of longitudinal variation in stream chemistry — relate to undisturbed streams, while the remainder relate to forest harvesting effects.},

Manual collection of water samples during floodsin small rivers is very difficult due to the short event duration and quick response to rainfall. Some low cost siphon samplers presented in the literature have been developed and adapted to collect event-based samples, but they only collect samples when the stream stage is rising. This work presents a new design of a low cost siphon sampler developed to allow collection when the stream stage is decreasing. It was tested in the laboratory and also installed in a river with flood flows strongly dominated by urban runoff. The major problem faced inthe field work was to keep the samplers in place due to the amount of debris carried by the floods. Laboratory tests showed water intrusion into the sampler during the rising stage and further improvement is proposed to solve the problem. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 IAHS Press.},

abstract = {Soil respiration, R(S), the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide (CO(2)) from the soil surface to the atmosphere, is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux. However, the dynamics of R(S) are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained. Ecosystem warming experiments, modelling analyses and fundamental biokinetics all suggest that R(S) should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R(S), inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure R(S) on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global R(S) values in the extant four-decade record of R(S) chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide R(S) observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R(S) record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO(2) measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961-1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in R(S). We estimate that the global R(S) in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 +/- 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) between 1989 and 2008, implying a global R(S) response to air temperature (Q(10)) of 1.5. An increasing global R(S) value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.},

abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is being increasingly used to help drinking water utilities meet finished water quality regulations, but its influence on disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors and DBP formation is not completely understood. This study investigated the effect of medium pressure (MP) UV combined with chlorination/chloramination on the fluorescent fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from a United States surface water with median total organic carbon content. Parallel factor analysis was used to understand how UV may alter the capacity of DOM to form DBPs of potential human health concern. The production of chloral hydrate and cyanogen chloride from MP UV followed by chlorine or chloramine, respectively, correlated with a decrease in fluorescence intensity of a protein/tryptophan-like component (R2=0.79-0.99) and a humic-like component (R2=0.91-1.00). This suggests that the UV-induced precursors to these compounds originated from DOM with similar characteristics to these components. The fluorescent DOM components identified in this study are similar to reoccurring components that have been previously identified in a range of raw and treated waters, and this work demonstrates the value of using fluorescence analysis of DOM to understand the relationships between DOM source and DBP formation under a range of treatment conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We examined a large DOM dataset from the National Water Information System of the U.S. Geological Survey, which represents approximately 100,000 measurements of DOC concentration and DOM composition at many sites along rivers across the United States. Application of quantile regression revealed a tendency towards downstream spatial and temporal homogenization of DOC concentrations and a shift from dominance of aromatic DOM in headwaters to more aliphatic DOM downstream. The DOC concentration – discharge (C-Q) relationships at each site revealed a downstream tendency towards a slope of zero.

Understanding the factors regulating this function for different gaseous, dissolved, and particulate constituents is critical to quantify the local and global effects of climate and land use change. We propose the River Network Saturation (RNS) concept as a generalization of how river network regulation of material fluxes declines with increasing flows due to imbalances between supply and demand at network scales. River networks have a tendency to become saturated (supply ≫ demand) under higher flow conditions because supplies increase faster than sink processes. However, the flow thresholds under which saturation occurs depends on a variety of factors, including the inherent process rate for a given constituent and the abundance of lentic waters such as lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and fluvial wetlands within the river network. As supply increases, saturation at network scales is initially limited by previously unmet demand in downstream aquatic ecosystems. The RNS concept describes a general tendency of river network function that can be used to compare the fate of different constituents among river networks. New approaches using nested in situ high-frequency sensors and spatially extensive synoptic techniques offer the potential to test the RNS concept in different settings. Better understanding of when and where river networks saturate for different constituents will allow for the extrapolation of aquatic function to broader spatial scales and therefore provide information on the influence of river function on continental element cycles and help identify policy priorities.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in streams is important, yet few studies focus on DOC dynamics in Midwestern streams during storms. In this study, stream DOC dynamics during storms in two Midwestern watersheds with contrasting land uses, the change in character of stream DOC during storms, and the usability of DOC as a hydrologic tracer in artificially drained landscapes of the Midwest are investigated. Major cation/DOC concentrations, and DOC specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and fluorescence index (FI) were monitored at 2-4 h intervals during three spring storms. Although DOC is less aromatic in the mixed land use watershed than in the agricultural watershed, land use has little impact on stream DOC concentration during storms. For both watersheds, DOC concentration follows discharge, and SUVA and FI values indicate an increase in stream DOC aromaticity and lignin content during storms. The comparison of DOC/major cation flushing dynamics indicates that DOC is mainly exported via overland flow/macropore flow. In both watersheds, the increase in DOC concentration in the streams during storms corresponds to a shift in the source of DOC from DOC originating from mineral soil layers of the soil profile at baseflow, to DOC originating from surficial soil layers richer in aromatic substances and lignin during storms. Results also suggest that DOC, SUVA and FI could be used as hydrologic tracers in artificially drained landscapes of the Midwest. These results underscore the importance of sampling streams for DOC during high flow periods in order to understand the fate of DOC in streams. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Snowmelt-runoff processes on frozen ground are poorly understood at the hillslope scale. This is especially true for hillslopes on the northern Great Plains of North America where long periods of snow-covered frozen ground with very shallow slopes mask any spatial patterns and process controls on connectivity and hillslope runoff generation. This study examines a 4.66 ha (46,600 m2) hillslope on the northern Great Plains during the 2014 spring snowmelt season to explore hillslope runoff processes. Specifically, we explore the spatial patterns of runoff production source areas and examine how surface topography and patterns of snow cover, snow water equivalent, soil water content, and thawed layer depth – which we measured on a 10 m grid across our 46,600 m2 hillslope – affect melt water partitioning and runoff connectivity. A key question was whether or not the controls on connectivity are consistent with the fill and spill mechanism found in rain-dominated and unfrozen soil domains. The contrast between the slow infiltration rates into frozen soil and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt delivery to the soil surface resulted in water accumulation in small depressions under the snowpack. Consequently, infiltration was minimal over the 12 day melt period. Instead, nested filling of micro- and meso-depressions was followed by macro-scale, whole-slope spilling. This spilling occurred when large patches of ponded water exceeded the storage capacity behind downslope micro barriers in the surface topography, and flows from them coalesced to drive a rapid increase in runoff at the hillslope outlet. These observations of ponded water and flowpaths followed mapable fill and spill locations based on 2 m resolution digital topographic analysis. Interestingly, while surface topography is relatively unimportant under unfrozen conditions at our site because of low relief and high infiltrability, surface topography shows episodically critical importance for connectivity and runoff generation when the ground is frozen.},

abstract = {In this study, the disinfection byproduct formation potential (DBPFP) of three surface waters with the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content of 2.5, 5.2, and 7.9. mg/L was investigated. The formation and distribution of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were evaluated. Samples collected from three surface waters in China were fractionated based on molecular weight and hydrophobicity. The raw water containing more hydrophobic (Ho) fraction exhibited higher formation potentials of haloacetic acid and trihalomethane. The DBPFP of the surface waters did not correlate with the DOC value. The values of DBPFP per DOC were correlated with the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) for Ho and Hi fractions. The obtained results suggested that SUVA cannot reveal the ability of reactive sites to form disinfection byproducts for waters with few aromatic structures. Combined with the analysis of FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the raw waters and the corresponding fractions, it was concluded that the Ho fraction with phenolic hydroxyl and conjugated double bonds was responsible for the production of trichloromethanes and trichloroacetic acids. The Hi fraction with amino and carboxyl groups had the potential to form dichloroacetic acids and chlorinated trihalomethanes. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {This paper presents a process for estimating pollutant loads from water quality data, to improve catchment-scale modelling in the region for resource management purposes. It describes a program to estimate suspended sediment, total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus loads to the Tuross estuary from the Tuross River catchment (1810 km2) of coastal southeast Australia. Event-based water quality sampling results obtained during storm events in 2005 are presented. Event 1, during July 2005 was the largest storm event in terms of peak flow for 3.5 years. Other events monitored were also in July, November and December 2005. The early July 2005 event had a flow-weighted mean suspended sediment (SS) concentration during the first 4 days of 63 mg L-1. Of the events monitored, this was unusual as it was preceded by drought and had the largest SS concentrations (peaking at 180 mg L-1) during the rising-stage. In contrast, the November event had a much lower flow-weighted SS mean (28 mg L-1), even though peak flow magnitudes were similar. The July and November 2005 events had peak flows of 12,360 and 11,330 ML day-1. Low-cost rising-stage siphon samplers were used to collect samples during the rapidly rising phase of these events. The use of such samplers and consideration of time-lead/lag flow adjustments, quantified using cross-correlation analysis to account for hysteresis effects, were incorporated into the load estimation techniques. The technique is a potentially useful approach for understanding relationships between water quality concentrations and flow for modelling catchment source strengths and transport processes.

@article{Genxu2009,
abstract = {As a result of global warming, the discharges from rivers in permafrost regions have varied significantly. However, its mechanism remains unclear. One of possible factors is active soil freeze-thaw cycle, which may influence surface runoff in the variation of permafrost water cycle processes. In this study, a typical permafrost watershed in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau was selected, its hydrological processes were monitored from 2004 to 2007, and the effects of the freezing and thawing depth of the soil active layer on runoff processes were assessed. The runoff modulus, runoff coefficient, direct runoff ratio, recession gradient and their seasonal variations were estimated and analyzed. The active soil dynamics and water budget were analyzed to prove the features of the surface runoff and the influences of active soil freeze-thaw processes. The primary factors influencing surface runoff processes during different seasons were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and statistical regression methods. The results showed that the high runoff coefficient and low direct runoff ratio were the main characteristics during the spring flood period (May-June) and during the autumn recession period (September). The runoff modulus and its year-to-year variability were the greatest in the summer flood period. The direct runoff ratio decreased from 0.43 in May to 0.29 in September, with the exception of the highest ratio, which occurred during the summer recession period (July). The active soil thawing in the upper layer of depth of 60 cm had contributed to increase in discharge, but the increase in thawing depth deeper than 60 cm led to a decrease in surface runoff and slowness in the recession process. Precipitation played a small role in the spring flood runoff and the autumn runoff. The soil active layer freeze-thaw variation, which affected seasonal soil water dynamic and water budget and reformed seasonal runoff characteristics, along with vegetation cover changes, is considered the potential major factor in control of the hydrological processes in the permafrost region. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Streams and rivers are important pathways for the export of atmospherically deposited mercury (Hg) from watersheds. Dissolved Hg (HgD) is strongly associated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream water, but the ratio of HgD to DOC is highly variable between watersheds. In this study, the HgD:DOC ratios from 19 watersheds were evaluated with respect to Hg wet deposition and watershed soil organic carbon (SOC) content. On a subset of sites where data were available, DOC quality measured by specific ultra violet absorbance at 254 nm, was considered as an additional factor that may influence HgD:DOC . No significant relationship was found between Hg wet deposition and HgD:DOC, but SOC content (g m22) was able to explain 81{\%} of the variance in the HgD:DOC ratio (ng mg21) following the form: HgD:DOC517.8*SOC20.41. The inclusion of DOC quality as a secondary predictor variable explained only an additional 1{\%} of the variance. A mathematical framework to interpret the observed power-law relationship between HgD:DOC and SOC suggests Hg supply limitation for adsorption to soils with relatively large carbon pools. With SOC as a primary factor controlling the association of HgD with DOC, SOC data sets may be utilized to predict stream HgD:DOC ratios on a more geographically widespread basis. In watersheds where DOC data are available, estimates of HgD may be readily obtained. Future Hg emissions policies must consider soil-mediated processes that affect the transport of Hg and DOC from terrestrial watersheds to streams for accurate predictions of water quality impacts.},

abstract = {It is important to understand how dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is processed and transported through stream networks because DOC is a master water quality variable in aquatic ecosystems. High-frequency sampling is necessary to capture important, rapid shifts in DOC source, concentration, and composition (i.e. quality) in streams. Until recently, this high-frequency sampling was logistically difficult or impossible. However, this type of sampling can now be conducted using in-situ optical measurements through long-term, field-deployable fluorometers and spectrophotometers. The optical data collected from these instruments can quantify both DOC concentration and composition properties (e.g., specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio, and fluorescence index). Previously, the use of these sensors was limited to a small number of specialized users, mainly in Europe and North America, where they were used predominantly in marine DOC studies as well as water treatment and management infrastructure. However, recent field demonstrations across a wide range of river systems reveals a large potential for the use of these instruments in freshwater environments, heightening interest and demand across multiple environmental research and management disciplines. Hence, this review provides an up-to-date synthesis on 1) the use of spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool in stream DOC studies, 2) the instrumentation, its applications, potential limitations and future considerations, and 3) the new watershed DOC research directions made possible via these in-situ optical sensors.},
