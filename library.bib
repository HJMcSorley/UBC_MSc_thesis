abstract = {Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are gaining traction as they offer mineralization potential rather than transferring contaminants between media. However, AOPs operated with limited energy and/or chemical inputs can exacerbate disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation, even as precursors such as dissolved organic carbon, UV254, and specific UV absorbance (SUVA) decrease. This study examined the relationship between DBP precursors and formation using TiO2 photocatalysis experiments, external AOP and non-AOP data, and predictive DBP models. The top-performing indicator, SUVA, generally correlated positively with trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, but limited-energy photocatalysis yielded contrasting negative correlations. The accuracy of predicted DBP values from models based on bulk parameters was generally poor, regardless of use and extent of AOP treatment and type of source water. Though performance improved for scenarios bounded by conditions used in model development, only 0.5{\%} of the model/dataset pairings satisfied all measured parameter boundary conditions, thereby introducing skepticism toward model usefulness. Study findings suggest that caution should be employed when using bulk indicators and/or models as a metric for AOP mitigation of DBP formation potential, particularly for limited-energy/chemical inputs.},

abstract = {Online monitoring dissolved organic matter (DOM) is urgent for water treatment management. In this study, high performance size exclusion chromatography with multi-UV absorbance and multi-emission fluorescence scans were applied to spectrally characterize samples from 16 drinking water sources across Yangzi River and Huai River Watersheds. The UV absorbance indices at 254 nm and 280 nm referred to the same DOM components and concentration, and the 280 nm UV light could excite both protein-like and humic-like fluorescence. Hence a novel UV fluorescence sensor was developed out using only one UV280 light-emitting diode (LED) as light source. For all samples, enhanced coagulation was mainly effective for large molecular weight biopolymers; while anion exchange further substantially removed humic substances. During chlorination tests, UVA280 and UVA254 showed similar correlations with yields of disinfection byproducts (DBPs); the humic-like fluorescence obtained from LED sensors correlated well with both trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids yields, while the correlation between protein-like fluorescence and trihalomethanes was relatively poor. Anion exchange exhibited more reduction of DBPs yields as well as UV absorbance and fluorescence signals than enhanced coagulation. The results suggest that the LED UV fluorescence sensors are very promising for online monitoring DOM and predicting DBPs formation potential during water treatment.},

abstract = {In this study, the disinfection byproduct formation potential (DBPFP) of three surface waters with the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content of 2.5, 5.2, and 7.9. mg/L was investigated. The formation and distribution of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were evaluated. Samples collected from three surface waters in China were fractionated based on molecular weight and hydrophobicity. The raw water containing more hydrophobic (Ho) fraction exhibited higher formation potentials of haloacetic acid and trihalomethane. The DBPFP of the surface waters did not correlate with the DOC value. The values of DBPFP per DOC were correlated with the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) for Ho and Hi fractions. The obtained results suggested that SUVA cannot reveal the ability of reactive sites to form disinfection byproducts for waters with few aromatic structures. Combined with the analysis of FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the raw waters and the corresponding fractions, it was concluded that the Ho fraction with phenolic hydroxyl and conjugated double bonds was responsible for the production of trichloromethanes and trichloroacetic acids. The Hi fraction with amino and carboxyl groups had the potential to form dichloroacetic acids and chlorinated trihalomethanes. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {The solution chemistry of forested streams primarily in western North America is explained by considering the major factors that influence this chemistry — geological weathering; atmospheric precipitation and climate; precipitation acidity; terrestrial biological processes; physical/chemical reactions in the soil; and physical, chemical, and biological processes within streams. Due to the complexity of all these processes and their varying importance for different chemicals, stream water chemistry has exhibited considerable geographic and temporal variation and is difficult to model accurately. The impacts of forest harvesting on stream water chemistry were reviewed by considering the effects of harvesting on each of the important factors controlling this chemistry, as well as other factors influencing these impacts - extent of the watershed harvested, presence of buffer strips between streams and harvested areas, nature of post-harvesting site preparation, revegetation rate following harvesting, pre-harvesting soil fertility, and soil buffering capacity. These effects have sometimes reinforced one another but have sometimes been counterbalancing or slight so that harvesting impacts on stream water chemistry have been highly variable. Eight major knowledge gaps were identified, two of which — a scarcity of detailed stream chemical budgets and knowledge of longitudinal variation in stream chemistry — relate to undisturbed streams, while the remainder relate to forest harvesting effects.},

abstract = {Natural organic matter (NOM) is found in all surface, ground and soilwaters. An increase in the amount of NOM has been observed over the past 10-20 years in rawwater supplies in several areas, which has a significant effect on drinking water treatment. The presence of NOMcausesmany problems in drinkingwater and drinkingwater treatment processes, including (i) negative effect onwater quality by causing colour, taste and odor problems, (ii) increased coagulant and disinfectant doses (which in turn results in increased sludge volumes and production of harmful disinfection by-products), (iii) promoted biological growth in distribution system, and (iv) increased levels of complexed heavy metals and adsorbed organic pollutants.NOMcan be removed fromdrinking water by several treatment options, of which the most common and economically feasible processes are considered to be coagulation and flocculation followed by sedimentation/flotation and sand filtration. Most of the NOM can be removed by coagulation, although, the hydrophobic fraction and high molar mass compounds of NOM are removed more efficiently than hydrophilic fraction and the lowmolar mass compounds. Thus, enhanced and/or optimized coagulation, aswell as newprocess alternatives for the better removal of NOMby coagulation process has been suggested. In the present work, an overview of the recent research dealing with coagulation and flocculation in the removal of NOM from drinking water is presented. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To better understand the effect of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transported by hydrological processes (rainfall, throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water; 0–20 cm) on soil respiration in tropical rainforests, we detected the DOC flux in rainfall, throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water (0–20 cm), compared the seasonality of $\delta$13CDOC in each hydrological process, and $\delta$13C in leaves, litter, and surface soil, and analysed the throughfall, litter leachate, and surface soil water (0–20 cm) effect on soil respiration in a tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna, south-west China. Results showed that the surface soil intercepted 94.4 ± 1.2 {\%} of the annual litter leachate DOC flux and is a sink for DOC. The throughfall and litter leachate DOC fluxes amounted to 6.81 and 7.23 {\%} of the net ecosystem exchange respectively, indicating that the DOC flux through hydrological processes is an important component of the carbon budget, and may be an important link between hydrological processes and soil respiration in a tropical rainforest. Even the variability in soil respiration is more dependent on the hydrologically transported water than DOC flux insignificantly, soil temperature, and soil-water content (at 0–20 cm). The difference in $\delta$13C between the soil, soil water (at 0–20 cm), throughfall, and litter leachate indicated that DOC is transformed in the surface soil and decreased the sensitivity indices of soil respiration of DOC flux to water flux, which suggests that soil respiration is more sensitive to the DOC flux in hydrological processes, especially the soil-water DOC flux, than to soil temperature or soil moisture.},

abstract = {Drinking water purveyors are increasingly relying on land conservation and management to ensure the safety of the water that they provide to consumers. To cost-effectively implement any such landscape initiatives, resources must be targeted to the appropriate spatial scale to address quality impairments of concern in a cost-effective manner. Using data gathered from 40 Canadian rivers across four ecozones, we examined the spatial scales at which land use was most closely associated with drinking source water quality metrics. Exploratory linear mixed-effects models accounting for climatic, hydrological, and physiographic variation among sites suggested that different spatial areas of land-use influence drinking source water quality depending on the parameter and season investigated. Escherichia coli spatial variability was only associated with land use at a local (5-10 km) spatial scale. Turbidity measures exhibited a complex association with land use, suggesting that the land-use areas of greatest influence can range from a 1 km subcatchment to the entire watershed depending on the season. Total organic carbon concentrations were only associated with land use characterized at the entire watershed scale. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index was used to calculate a composite measure of seasonal drinking source water quality but did not provide additional information beyond the analyses of individual parameters. These results suggest that entire watershed management is required to safeguard drinking water sources with more focused efforts at targeted spatial scales to reduce specific risk parameters.

abstract = {Watersheds are three-dimensional hydrologic systems where the longitudinal expansion/contraction of stream networks, vertical connection/disconnection between shallow and deep groundwater systems, and lateral connectivity of these water sources to streams mediate runoff production and nutrient export. The connectivity of runoff source areas during both baseflow and stormflow conditions and their combined influence on biogeochemical fluxes remain poorly understood. Here we focused on a set of 3.3 and 48.4 ha nested watersheds (North Carolina, USA). These watersheds comprise ephemeral and intermittent runoff-producing headwaters and perennial runoff-producing lowlands. Within these landscape elements, we characterized the timing and magnitude of precipitation, runoff, and runoff-generating flow paths. The active surface drainage network (ASDN) reflected connectivity to, and contributions from, source areas that differed under baseflow and stormflow conditions. The baseflow-associated ASDN expanded and contracted seasonally, driven by the rise and fall of the seasonal water table. Superimposed on this were event-activated source area contributions driven by connectivity to surficial and shallow subsurface flow paths. Frequently activated shallow flow paths also caused increased in-stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with increases in runoff across both watershed scales. The spread and variability within this DOC-runoff relationship was driven by a seasonal depletion of DOC from continual shallow subsurface flow path activation and subsequent replenishment from autumn litterfall. Our findings suggest that hydrobiogeochemical signals at larger watershed outlets can be driven by the expansion, contraction, and connection of lateral, longitudinal, and vertical source areas with distinct runoff generation processes.},

abstract = {High-resolution in situ total phosphorus (TP), total reactive phosphorus (TRP) and turbidity (TURB) time series are presented for a groundwater-dominated agricultural catchment. Meta-analysis of concentration-discharge (. c-. q) intra-storm signatures for 61 storm events revealed dominant hysteretic patterns with similar frequency of anti-clockwise and clockwise responses; different determinands (TP, TRP, TURB) behaved similarly. We found that the c-. q loop direction is controlled by seasonally variable flow discharge and temperature whereas the magnitude is controlled by antecedent rainfall. Anti-clockwise storm events showed lower flow discharge and higher temperature compared to clockwise events. Hydrological controls were more important for clockwise events and TP and TURB responses, whereas in-stream biogeochemical controls were important for anti-clockwise storm events and TRP responses. Based on the best predictors of the direction of the hysteresis loops, we calibrated and validated a simple fuzzy logic inference model (FIS) to determine likely direction of the c-. q responses. We show that seasonal and inter-storm succession in clockwise and anti-clockwise responses corroborates the transition in P transport from a chemostatic to an episodic regime. Our work delivers new insights for the evidence base on the complexity of phosphorus dynamics. We show the critical value of high-frequency in situ observations in advancing understanding of freshwater biogeochemical processes.},

abstract = {Conventional water treatment processes (e.g., coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration) are widely used for producing drinking water from surface water sources. Transient, gradual, or abrupt changes in source water quality that could compromise treatment effectiveness can be triggered by climate and related meteorological events, accidental or intentional contamination, security breaches, or other disruptions. However, the design principles that underpin the majority of existing conventional treatment systems predate climate adaptation considerations. This paper considers the adaptation capacity of conventional water treatment systems. A modeling framework is used to illustrate climate adaptation mechanisms that could enable conventional treatment systems to accommodate water quality impairments. Treatment system resiliency is explored in response to generic climate-relevant water quality perturbations such as extreme temperature variations and changes in the quantity and characteristics of solids, particles, and organic constituents. Promising adaptation options include modifying chemical parameters (e.g., types of chemicals, dosages, sequence of chemical addition, mixing intensity and duration), filter operations, and microbiological augmentation of existing physical/chemical treatment systems. The capacity reserve concept provides an organizing principle that could be useful for prioritizing climate adaptation strategies such as major or minor treatment/infrastructure modifications, system-wide upgrades such as off-line storage, operational changes in distribution systems, or the use of supplemental water sources including reclaimed or recycled water.},

abstract = {Disinfection by-products (DBPs) are formed when disinfectants (chlorine, ozone, chlorine dioxide, or chloramines) react with naturally occurring organic matter, anthropogenic contaminants, bromide, and iodide during the production of drinking water. Here we review 30 years of research on the occurrence, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity of 85 DBPs, 11 of which are currently regulated by the U.S., and 74 of which are considered emerging DBPs due to their moderate occurrence levels and/or toxicological properties. These 74 include halonitromethanes, iodo-acids and other unregulated halo-acids, iodo-trihalomethanes (THMs), and other unregulated halomethanes, halofuranones (MX [3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone] and brominated MX DBPs), haloamides, haloacetonitriles, tribromopyrrole, aldehydes, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and other nitrosamines. Alternative disinfection practices result in drinking water from which extracted organic material is less mutagenic than extracts of chlorinated water. However, the levels of many emerging DBPs are increased by alternative disinfectants (primarily ozone or chloramines) compared to chlorination, and many emerging DBPs are more genotoxic than some of the regulated DBPs. Our analysis identified three categories of DBPs of particular interest. Category 1 contains eight DBPs with some or all of the toxicologic characteristics of human carcinogens: four regulated (bromodichloromethane, dichloroacetic acid, dibromoacetic acid, and bromate) and four unregulated DBPs (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, MX, and NDMA). Categories 2 and 3 contain 43 emerging DBPs that are present at moderate levels (sub- to low-$\mu$g/L): category 2 contains 29 of these that are genotoxic (including chloral hydrate and chloroacetaldehyde, which are also a rodent carcinogens); category 3 contains the remaining 14 for which little or no toxicological data are available. In general, the brominated DBPs are both more genotoxic and carcinogenic than are chlorinated compounds, and iodinated DBPs were the most genotoxic of all but have not been tested for carcinogenicity. There were toxicological data gaps for even some of the 11 regulated DBPs, as well as for most of the 74 emerging DBPs. A systematic assessment of DBPs for genotoxicity has been performed for ∼60 DBPs for DNA damage in mammalian cells and 16 for mutagenicity in Salmonella. A recent epidemiologic study found that much of the risk for bladder cancer associated with drinking water was associated with three factors: THM levels, showering/bathing/swimming (i.e., dermal/inhalation exposure), and genotype (having the GSTT1-1 gene). This finding, along with mechanistic studies, highlights the emerging importance of dermal/inhalation exposure to the THMs, or possibly other DBPs, and the role of genotype for risk for drinking-water-associated bladder cancer. More than 50{\%} of the total organic halogen (TOX) formed by chlorination and more than 50{\%} of the assimilable organic carbon (AOC) formed by ozonation has not been identified chemically. The potential interactions among the 600 identified DBPs in the complex mixture of drinking water to which we are exposed by various routes is not reflected in any of the toxicology studies of individual DBPs. The categories of DBPs described here, the identified data gaps, and the emerging role of dermal/inhalation exposure provide guidance for drinking water and public health research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Isotope data from streamflow samples taken during rainfall or snowmelt events can be useful for model calibration, particularly to improve model consistency and to reduce parameter uncertainty. To reduce the costs associated with stream water sampling, it is important to choose sampling times with a high information content. We used the Birkenes model and synthetic rainfall, streamflow and isotope data to explore how many samples are needed to obtain a certain model fit and which sampling times are most informative for model calibration. Our results for nine model parameterizations and three events, representing different streamflow behaviours (e.g., fast and slow response, with and without overflow), show that the simulation performance of models calibrated with isotope data from two selected samples was comparable to simulations based on isotope data for all 100 time steps. Generally, samples taken on the falling limb were most informative for model calibration, although the exact timing of the most informative samples was dependent on the runoff response. Samples taken on the rising limb and at peakflow were less informative than expected. These model results highlight the value of a limited number of stream water samples and provide guidance for cost-effective event-based sampling strategies for model calibration.},

abstract = {Subsurface flow from hillslopes is widely recognized as an important contributor to streamflow generation; however, processes that control how and when hillslopes connect to streams remain unclear. We investigated stream and hillslope runoff dynamics through a wet-up period in watershed 10 of the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascades of Oregon where the riparian zone has been removed by debris flows. We examined the controls on hillslope-stream connectivity on the basis of observations of hydrometric, stable isotope, and applied tracer responses and computed transit times for multiple runoff components for a series of storms during the wet-up phase of the 2002-2003 winter rainy season. Hillslope discharge was distinctly threshold-like with a near linear response and average quick flow ratio of 0.58 when antecedent rainfall was greater than 20 mm. Hillslope and stream stormflow varied temporally and showed strong hysteretic relationships. Event water mean transit times (8-34 h) and rapid breakthrough from applied hillslope tracer additions demonstrated that subsurface contributing areas extend far upslope during events. Despite rapid hillslope transport processes during events, soil water and runoff mean transit times during nonstorm conditions were greater than the time scale of storm events. Soil water mean transit times ranged between 10 and 25 days. Hillslope seepage and catchment base flow mean transit times were between 1 and 2 years. We describe a conceptual model that captures variable physical flow pathways, their synchronicity, threshold activation, hysteresis, and transit times through changing antecedent wetness conditions that illustrate the different stages of hillslope and stream connectivity. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Snowmelt-runoff processes on frozen ground are poorly understood at the hillslope scale. This is especially true for hillslopes on the northern Great Plains of North America where long periods of snow-covered frozen ground with very shallow slopes mask any spatial patterns and process controls on connectivity and hillslope runoff generation. This study examines a 4.66 ha (46,600 m2) hillslope on the northern Great Plains during the 2014 spring snowmelt season to explore hillslope runoff processes. Specifically, we explore the spatial patterns of runoff production source areas and examine how surface topography and patterns of snow cover, snow water equivalent, soil water content, and thawed layer depth – which we measured on a 10 m grid across our 46,600 m2 hillslope – affect melt water partitioning and runoff connectivity. A key question was whether or not the controls on connectivity are consistent with the fill and spill mechanism found in rain-dominated and unfrozen soil domains. The contrast between the slow infiltration rates into frozen soil and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt delivery to the soil surface resulted in water accumulation in small depressions under the snowpack. Consequently, infiltration was minimal over the 12 day melt period. Instead, nested filling of micro- and meso-depressions was followed by macro-scale, whole-slope spilling. This spilling occurred when large patches of ponded water exceeded the storage capacity behind downslope micro barriers in the surface topography, and flows from them coalesced to drive a rapid increase in runoff at the hillslope outlet. These observations of ponded water and flowpaths followed mapable fill and spill locations based on 2 m resolution digital topographic analysis. Interestingly, while surface topography is relatively unimportant under unfrozen conditions at our site because of low relief and high infiltrability, surface topography shows episodically critical importance for connectivity and runoff generation when the ground is frozen.},

abstract = {Six methods were compared for calculating annual stream exports of sulfate, nitrate, calcium, magnesium and aluminum from six small Appalachian watersheds. Approximately 250-400 stream samples and concurrent stream flow measurements were collected during baseflows and storm flows for the 1989 water year at five Pennsylvania watersheds and during the 1989-1992 water years at a West Virginia watershed. Continuous stream flow records were also collected at each watershed. Solute exports were calculated from the complete data set using six different scenarios ranging from instantaneous monthly measurements of stream chemistry and stream flow, to intensive monitoring of storm flow events and multiple regression equations. The results for five of the methods were compared with the regression method because statistically significant models were developed and the regression equations allowed for prediction of solute concentrations during unsampled storm flows. Results indicated that continuous stream flow measurement was critical to producing exports within 10{\%} of regression estimates. For solutes whose concentrations were not correlated strongly with stream flow, weekly grab samples combined with continuous records of stream flow were sufficient to produce export estimates within 10{\%} of the regression method. For solutes whose concentrations were correlated strongly with stream flow, more intensive sampling during storm flows or the use of multiple regression equations were the most appropriate methods, especially for watersheds where stream flows changed most quickly. Concentration-stream flow relationships, stream hydrological response, available resources and required level of accuracy of chemical budgets should be considered when choosing a method for calculating solute exports. {\textcopyright} 1997 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Forest hydrology should be a mature science with routine use of hydrological procedures to evaluate the effect of past, current and proposed harvesting practices on water resources. It is not. However, water users are pressuring forest managers to exercise their role in managing forested watersheds for water supply. Most forest managers are poorly equipped to carry out this role. Forestry schools need to ensure that their graduates, whether employed in forest management positions or as specialists in watershed management, understand that all forestry operations may affect instream or downstream water users. Specialists in forest hydrology should be fully aware of the following: (1) climate and watershed characteristics influence streamflow in separate ways; (2) forestry practices produce changes in water yield and quality, and that only these changes need to be evaluated to estimate their effects; (3) watershed storage is a critical factor in evaluating the effects of harvesting on streamflow; and (4) the effect of harvest on one watershed cannot be extrapolated to another without consideration of the processes affected. Research is needed to assist watershed managers in applying models to watersheds for which climate and streamflow data are insufficient. Research is also needed to incorporate climate, streamflow and other data for hydrological models into geographic information systems. Joint research projects are needed to develop physical relationships between stream channel characteristics of importance to fisheries biologists and streamflow characteristics affected by forest harvest.},

abstract = {While the influence of antecedent conditions on watershed function is widely recognized under typical hydrologic regimes, gaps remain in the context of extreme climate events (ECEs). ECEs are those events that far exceed seasonal norms of intensity, duration, or impact upon the physical environment or ecosystem. In this synthesis, we discuss the role of source availability and hydrologic connectivity on antecedent conditions and propose a conceptual framework to characterize system response to ECEs at the watershed scale. We present four case studies in detail that span a range of types of antecedent conditions and type of ECE to highlight important controls and feedbacks. Because ECEs have the potential to export large amounts of water and materials, their occurrence in sequence can disproportionately amplify the response. In fact, multiple events may not be considered extreme in isolation, but when they occur in close sequence they may lead to extreme responses in terms of both supply and transport capacity. Therefore, to advance our understanding of these complexities, we need continued development of a mechanistic understanding of how antecedent conditions set the stage for ECE response across multiple regions and climates, particularly since monitoring of these rare events is costly and difficult to obtain. Through focused monitoring of critical ecosystems during rare events we will also be able to extend and validate modeling studies. Cross-regional comparisons are also needed to define characteristics of resilient systems. These monitoring, modeling, and synthesis efforts are more critical than ever in light of changing climate regimes, intensification of human modifications of the landscape, and the disproportionate impact of ECEs in highly populated regions.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the physical properties that appear in the various formulas and figures in the text, specifically density, melting temperature and range, specific heat, thermal conductivity, and electrical resistivity. Density is the mass of a material per unit volume of that material. The most common units in modern technical literature are grams per cubic centimeter. Theoretical densities of pure crystalline substances can be calculated from the unit cell of the crystal structure. Pure metals, as opposed to alloys, have specific melting temperatures. Most alloys, however, have a range of temperatures, where both liquid and solid phases are present. The specific heat of a material is the heat, or thermal energy, required to raise a given mass by one degree of temperature. The most common units in the modern technical literature are joules per kilogram per degrees Kelvin. The thermal conductivity of a material is the constant relating the steady-state heat flow, in energy per unit area per unit time, to the temperature gradient in degrees per unit length. Thermal conductivity in metals decreases substantially with increases in temperature. The electrical resistivity of a length of wire is its electrical resistance, in ohms, times its cross-sectional area divided by its length. In the case of metals, electrical and thermal conductivity are closely related, since electron motion is the principal vehicle in each case.},

This study compares the influence of land use and climate on DBP precursors in two catchments supplying the region around the City of Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada, and assesses the variability of Disinfection By-Product (DBP) concentration and speciation following rainfall events. DBPs (trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs)) and their precursors in raw waters (pH, turbidity, specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), total and dissolved organic carbon, bromides and chlorine dose) were monitored. Various experimental chlorination tests, DBP formation potential (DBPFP) and Simulated Distribution Systems (SDS), were also performed. Differences in pre-rainfall (baseflow) water quality were noted according to the different watershed land uses. Raw water quality patterns showed modifications between baseflow and rainfall periods, with a degradation of raw water quality according to turbidity and SUVA in both water sources. Rainfall events were also shown to alter organic matter reactivity with an increase in THM formation potential for both sites. A less noticeable impact on HAA formation potential was observed. However, no clear differences in DBPFP tests were observed between the sites. SDS tests showed that rainfall events lead to considerable rises in organic carbon reactivity of filtered waters, even after primary treatment, with a 2-fold increase in THM and HAA concentrations following rainfall for waters representing the end of one main distribution system (20 h contact time). These increases are linked mainly to a rise in non-brominated DBPs such as chloroform, trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid. This study confirms the importance of strictly controlling OM levels during drinking water treatment to ensure safe drinking water quality throughout the distribution system.},

Here, we assess long-term water quality time series from three nested headwater streams draining upland forest (C2), peat/mire (C4) and mixed (C7) (forest and mire) catchments. Acid deposition in this region is low and is further declining. Temporal trends in weather and runoff (1981-2008), dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] (1993-2010) and other water quality parameters (1987-2011) were assessed. There was no significant annual trend in precipitation or runoff. However, runoff increased in March and declined in May. This suggested an earlier snowmelt regime in recent years. Significant monotonic increasing trends in air temperature and length of growing season suggested a decrease in snowfall and less spring runoff. Stream [DOC] was positively correlated with some trace metals (copper, iron and zinc) and negatively with several other chemical parameters (e.g. sulfate, conductivity, calcium). Both sulfate and conductivity showed declining trends, while a significant increase was observed in pH during winter and spring. Calcium and magnesium showed monotonic decreasing trends. The declining trajectories of stream base cation and sulfate concentrations during other times of the year were not accompanied by changes in pH and alkalinity. These results indicate subtle effects of recovery from acidification. Water temperature increased significantly both annually and in most months. A simultaneous monotonic increase in iron (Fe) and [DOC] in autumn suggests co-transport of Fe-DOC in the form of organometallic complexes. A monotonic increase in UV absorbance in most months without co-occurring changes in DOC trend suggests a shift in DOC quality to a more humicrich type. The observed increase in soil solution [DOC] and subtle trends in stream [DOC] suggest that climate rather than recovery from acidification is the dominant driver of DOC trends in the Svartberget catchment. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {Dynamics of solute export from catchments can be classified in terms of chemostatic and chemodynamic export regimes by an analysis of concentration-discharge relationships. Previous studies hypothesized that distinct export regimes emerge from the presence of solute mass stores within the catchment and their connectivity to the stream. However, so far a direct link of solute export to identifiable catchment characteristics is missing. Here we investigate long-term time series of stream water quality and quantity of nine neighboring catchments in Central Germany ranging from relatively pristine mountain catchments to agriculturally dominated lowland catchments, spanning large gradients in land use, geology, and climatic conditions. Given the strong collinearity of catchment characteristics we used partial least square regression analysis to quantify the predictive power of these characteristics for median concentrations and the metrics of export regime. We can show that median concentrations and metrics of the export regimes of major ions and nutrients can indeed be inferred from catchment characteristics. Strongest predictors for median concentrations were the share of arable land, discharge per area, runoff coefficient and available water capacity in the root zone of the catchments. The available water capacity in the root zone, the share of arable land being artificially drained and the topographic gradient were found to be the most relevant predictors for the metrics of export regime. These catchment characteristics can represent the size of solute mass store such as the fraction of arable land being a measure for the store of nitrate. On the other hand, catchment characteristics can be a measure for the connectivity of these solute stores to the stream such as the fraction of tile drained land in the catchments. This study demonstrates the potential of data-driven, top down analyses using simple metrics to classify and better understand dominant controls of solute export from catchments.},

abstract = {A better understanding of how hydrological and biogeochemical processes control dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition from headwaters downstream to large rivers is needed. We examined a large DOM dataset from the National Water Information System of the U.S. Geological Survey, which represents approximately 100,000 measurements of DOC concentration and DOM composition at many sites along rivers across the United States. Application of quantile regression revealed a tendency towards downstream spatial and temporal homogenization of DOC concentrations and a shift from dominance of aromatic DOM in headwaters to more aliphatic DOM downstream. The DOC concentration – discharge (C-Q) relationships at each site revealed a downstream tendency towards a slope of zero. We propose that despite complexities in river networks that have driven many revisions to the River Continuum concept, rivers show a tendency towards chemostasis (C-Q slope of zero) because of a ...},

abstract = {Four significant areas of thought, (1) the holistic approach, (2) the linkage between streams and their terrestrial setting, (3) material cycling in open systems, and (4) biotic interactions and integration of community ecology principles, have provided a basis for the further development of stream ecosystem theory. The River Continuum Concept (RCC) represents a synthesis of these ideas. Suggestions are made for clarifying, expanding, and refining the RCC to encompass broader spatial and temporal scales. Factors important in this regard include climate and geology, tributaries, location-specific lithology and geomorphology, and long-term changes imposed by man. It appears that most riverine ecosystems can be accommodated within this expanded conceptual framework and that the RCC continues to represent a useful paradigm for understanding and comparing the ecology of streams and rivers.},

However, little is known concerning effects of the fire triangle (heat, oxygen, and fuel) on DOM alteration.

abstract = {Natural organic matter (NOM) is found in all surface, ground and soil waters. During recent decades, reports worldwide show a continuing increase in the color and NOM of the surface water, which has an adverse affect on drinking water purification. For several practical and hygienic reasons, the presence of NOM is undesirable in drinking water. Various technologies have been proposed for NOM removal with varying degrees of success. The properties and amount of NOM, however, can significantly affect the process efficiency. In order to improve and optimise these processes, the characterisation and quantification of NOM at different purification and treatment processes stages is important. It is also important to be able to understand and predict the reactivity of NOM or its fractions in different steps of the treatment. Methods used in the characterisation of NOM include resin adsorption, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The amount of NOM in water has been predicted with parameters including UV-Vis, total organic carbon (TOC), and specific UV-absorbance (SUVA). Recently, methods by which NOM structures can be more precisely determined have been developed; pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), multidimensional NMR techniques, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). The present review focuses on the methods used for characterisation and quantification of NOM in relation to drinking water treatment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is importantto ecosystem functioning and of interest to drinking water treatment as it is costlyto remove from source water. The effects of land use change(e.g. forest harvest)on DOC are not fully understood. Past studies of the effects of forestry on DOC have found mixed results, and covariate effects complicate mechanistic understanding and mayunderlie regional differences.DOCistypically highest during storm events, and detailed time-resolved measurements of DOC over longer periodsare just becoming feasible with advances in in situsensors. In this thesis, I investigated DOC concentration and character for headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest history in the UBC Malcolm Knapp Research Forest near Maple Ridge, British Columbia,and discussed implications for water treatment through expert interviews with water treatment engineers atMetro Vancouver.I took a two-pronged approachto the field studyby measuring not only temporally detailedDOC concentration at two contrasting sites, but also spatially broad DOC concentration and character at 24 sites for six time points during the same study period.From the temporal analysis,I found base flow DOC concentration to be lower in the clear-cutstream (Clear cut: 2.26 ± 0.43 mg/L; Forested:4.30 ± 0.83 mg/L), but storm response to be stronger (mean increase DOC: Clear cut: 2.42 mg/L,Forested: 1.99 mg/L). LowerDOC concentration after cutting may be due to reductions in carbon inputs like leaf litter, though differences in drainage area and the presence of a bog lake may also account for some of the observed difference. Elevatedstorm responsesmay be due to changes in flow paths related to forest harvesting.From the broad sampling analysis, I founddifferences in DOC characterbetween the two land use types:DOC in clear-cutsites was more protein-like whereas DOC in forested sites it was more humic-like,althoughonce random factors were taken into account in generalized linear mixed models, the relationship was no longer significant.Using categorization and regression treemodeling, I found drainage area to be the most important covariate related to DOC followed by time of year(i.e. seasonality).},

abstract = {Techniques for preserving surface water samples are recently in demand because of the increased interest in quantifying dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters and the frequent collection of samples in remote locations. Freezing is a common technique employed by many researchers for preserving surface water samples; however, there has been little evaluation of the effects of freezing on DOM concentrations. Ten streams were sampled in southeast Alaska with a range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (1.5 to 39 mg C L- 1) to evaluate the influence of freezing (flash and standard freeze) and filter pore size (0.2 and 0.7 $\mu$m nominal pore size) on dissolved organic C, N and P concentrations. We report a significant decrease in DOC (p {\textless} 0.005) and total dissolved P (p {\textless} 0.005) concentrations when streamwater samples were frozen, whereas concentrations of dissolved organic N did not significantly decrease after freezing (p = 0.06). We further show that when surface water samples were frozen, there was a decrease in the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) of DOC that is particularly evident with high concentrations of DOC. This finding suggests that spectroscopic properties of DOC have the potential to be used as indicators of whether surface water samples can be frozen. Our results lead us to recommend that surface water samples with high DOC concentrations ({\textgreater} 5 mg C L- 1) and/or samples with high SUVA values ({\textgreater} 3.5-4 L mg-C- 1 m- 1) should be analyzed immediately and not frozen. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The character and quantity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were studied in nine small boreal streams and adjacent soils during two years, with focus on the spring snowmelt period. The streams cover a forest-wetland gradient, spanning from 0{\%} to 69{\%} wetland coverage. Lower values of the absorbance ratio measured at 254 nm and 365 nm (A254/A365), in both soil plots and streams, indicated that wetland-derived DOC had higher average molecular weight than forest DOC. Higher SUVA254 (DOC specific ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm) in wetland runoff indicated more aromatic DOC from wetlands than forests. During low flow, the stream DOC character was sensitive to the forest-wetland proportion of the catchment, and when wetland coverage exceeded 10{\%}, the streams appeared to be dominated by wetland-derived DOC. During the spring snowmelt period, the character changed to lower molecular weight and more aliphatic DOC, particularly in streams with a high proportion of forest in the catchment. The forested soil solutions had higher A 25/A365 in the surface horizons that were hydrologically activated during the high flow events, while wetland soil solution had relatively low A254/A365 at all depths. Consequently forest soils contributed more to stream DOC concentration during snowmelt that during winter low flow. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

@article{Wollheim2018,
abstract = {River networks modify material transfer from land to ocean. Understanding the factors regulating this function for different gaseous, dissolved, and particulate constituents is critical to quantify the local and global effects of climate and land use change. We propose the River Network Saturation (RNS) concept as a generalization of how river network regulation of material fluxes declines with increasing flows due to imbalances between supply and demand at network scales. River networks have a tendency to become saturated (supply ≫ demand) under higher flow conditions because supplies increase faster than sink processes. However, the flow thresholds under which saturation occurs depends on a variety of factors, including the inherent process rate for a given constituent and the abundance of lentic waters such as lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and fluvial wetlands within the river network. As supply increases, saturation at network scales is initially limited by previously unmet demand in downstream aquatic ecosystems. The RNS concept describes a general tendency of river network function that can be used to compare the fate of different constituents among river networks. New approaches using nested in situ high-frequency sensors and spatially extensive synoptic techniques offer the potential to test the RNS concept in different settings. Better understanding of when and where river networks saturate for different constituents will allow for the extrapolation of aquatic function to broader spatial scales and therefore provide information on the influence of river function on continental element cycles and help identify policy priorities.},

abstract = {Background: Random forests are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific fields because they can cope with "small n large p" problems, complex interactions and even highly correlated predictor variables. Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables. Results: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure. Conclusion: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {It is well known that the composition of land cover within a watershed plays a large role in regulating stream water quality. However, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the effect of spatial configuration of different types of land cover on water quality. Using periphytic algae (diatoms) as indicators of stream trophic state, we investigated the relationship between landscape configuration and water quality in a large number of watersheds (590) at varying catchment scales in Eastern Canada. Variation partitioning analysis showed that landscape configuration explained 48{\%} of the variation in water quality. However, since the physiographic setting constrains most agricultural activities, most of the variation was attributed to the shared influence of surficial deposits, land cover and landscape configuration (34{\%}). The results from regression models showed that the geomorphological setting of watersheds (surficial deposits and slopes) and the proportion of different land cover types (mainly forests, wetlands, crops and urban areas) have a major impact on stream water quality. Nevertheless, a few configuration metrics emerged as important factors. Landscape diversity appeared to have a negative impact on water quality, whereas forest and wetland edge densities had a positive impact. Moreover, the influence of these lanscape metrics seems to occur at certain thresholds. In areas of intensive farming, streams with a forest area that covers at least 47{\%} of the watershed have a better water quality. Below this threshold, eutrophic and meso-eutrophic conditions are more frequent in streams and rivers. The shape and location of forested patches were also found to be relevant. Woodlands and wetlands with an edge density higher than 36 m/ha and located along streams and gullies have a positive impact on water quality. For the same proportion of forest, complex patches will be more efficient filters than large regular patches. Forest edge density seems to control the extent of the interface with the agricultural sources and thus promotes the “sink” effect of forests on nutrients.},

Land use, land cover and elevation were quantified for both entire catchments and the upland-river ecotone (100 m stream buffer strip). Catchment and ecotone data were then empirically compared with stream water chemistry using multivariate and regression analyses. Redundancy analysis was used to partition variance among land use, geology, and the shared influence of land use and geology. 2. Major catchments dominated by rowcrop agriculture had the highest alkalinity, total dissolved solids and nitrate + nitrite concentrations. 3. Strong seasonal differences were observed in total nitrogen and nitrite + nitrate, but not in total phosphorus or suspended solids. Land use and landscape structure factors such as slope and patch density (number of land use patches per km2) accounted for most of the observed variance in summer. 4. In both autumn and summer, landscape factors accounted for much of the observed variation in total dissolved solids and alkalinity. During autumn, geological factors and the shared influence of geology/landscape structure plus land use exerted more influence than did land use alone. 5. Total phosphorus and total suspended solids were much better explained by land use within the stream ecotone in summer than in other seasons. However, total nitrogen, nitrate, orthophosphate and alkalinity were equally well explained by land use within the ecotone and throughout the whole catchment. Only total dissolved solids in summer and ammonium in autumn were explained better by the whole catchment than the ecotone. 6. Our results show that relatively coarse spatial databases can provide useful descriptors of regional water quality.},

Although UV absorption can be used to detect certain indi-vidual organic contaminants after separation [e.g., by high-per-formance liquid chromatography (HPLC)], as described in Part 6000, the method described here is not suitable for detecting trace concentrations of individual chemicals. Rather, it provides an indication of the aggregate concentration of UV-absorbing organic constituents. 2. References 1. DOBBS, R.A., R.H. WISE {\&} R.B. DEAN. 1972.

abstract = {Accurate partitioning of precipitation into infiltration and runoff is a fundamental objective of land surface models tasked with characterizing the surface water and energy balance. Temporal variability in this partitioning is due, in part, to changes in prestorm soil moisture, which determine soil infiltration capacity and unsaturated storage. Utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-4 soil moisture product in combination with streamflow and precipitation observations, we demonstrate that land surface models (LSMs) generally underestimate the strength of the positive rank correlation between prestorm soil moisture and event runoff coefficients (i.e., the fraction of rainfall accumulation volume converted into stormflow runoff during a storm event). Underestimation is largest for LSMs employing an infiltration-excess approach for stormflow runoff generation. More accurate coupling strength is found in LSMs that explicitly represent subsurface stormflow or saturation-excess runoff generation processes.},

abstract = {Plots of solute concentration against discharge have been used to relate stream hydrochemical variations to processes of flow generation, using data collected at four streams in the Catskill Mountains, New York, during the Episodic Response Project of the US Environmental Protection Agency. Results suggest that a two-component system of shallow and deep saturated subsurface flow, in which the two components respond simultaneously during hydrologic events, may be applicable to the study basins. Using a large natural sea-salt sodium input as a tracer for precipitation, it is argued that an additional distinction can be made between pre-event and event water travelling along the shallow subsurface flow path. Pre-event water is thought to be displaced by infiltrating event water, which becomes dominant on the falling limb of the hydrograph. Where, as appears to be the case for sulfate, a solute equilibrates rapidly within the soil, the pre-event-event water distinction is unimportant. However, for some solutes there are clear and consistent compositional differences between water from the two sources, evident as a hysteresis loop in concentration-discharge plots. Nitrate and acidity, in particular, appear to be elevated in event water following percolation through the organic horizon. Consequently, the most acidic, high nitrate conditions during an episode generally occur after peak discharge. A simple conceptual model of episode runoff generation is presented on the basis of these results.},

This limits our ability to predict the fluvial carbon flux responses to changes in climate and land use. We used DOC concentration and discharge patterns with ensemble modeling techniques to quantify DOC flux behavior for 1,006 U.S. watersheds spanning diverse climate and land cover conditions. We found that DOC flux was transport-limited (concentration increased with discharge) in 80{\%} of watersheds and that this flux behavior spanned ecoregions and watershed sizes. The generality of transport limitation demonstrates how coupling discharge models with widely available watershed properties could allow DOC flux to be efficiently integrated into landscape and Earth system models.},

abstract = {River water quality sampling frequency is an important aspect of the river water quality monitoring network. A suitable sampling frequency for each station as well as for the whole network will provide a measure of the real water quality status for the water quality managers as well as the decision makers. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is an effective method for decision analysis and calculation of weighting factors based on multiple criteria to solve complicated problems. This study introduces a new procedure to design river water quality sampling frequency by applying the AHP. We introduce and combine weighting factors of variables with the relative weights of stations to select the sampling frequency for each station, monthly and yearly. The new procedure was applied for Jingmei and Xindian rivers, Taipei, Taiwan. The results showed that sampling frequency should be increased at high weighted stations while decreased at low weighted stations. In addition, a detailed monitoring plan for each station and each month could be scheduled from the output results. Finally, the study showed that the AHP is a suitable method to design a system for sampling frequency as it could combine multiple weights and multiple levels for stations and variables to calculate a final weight for stations, variables, and months. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {[1] Quality concerns drive many water studies and practices, but obtaining samples from water bodies over time and space for quality determination is often difficult and expensive. We present a low-cost approach that allows integration of water samples over timescales of days to months to allow more widely distributed acquisition of time-integrated samples than possible with previous technology. The device is simply a submerged bottle with a small hole in the lid. In an alternative design the submerged bottle is connected by a tube to a second bottle located outside of the water. In either case, pressure changes inside the sampler arising from natural fluctuations in temperature and atmospheric pressure lead to an accumulation of water in the bottle. For example, when the sampler warms, air escapes the hole, and when it cools, water enters the hole, so with daily variation of 6°C per day the bottle will half fill in 1 month. Laboratory and environmental tests confirm the concept's function. Variants of the design for well sampling and use in deep water are also presented.

Our data indicate that SUVA, determined at 254 nm, is strongly correlated with percent aromaticity as determined by 13C NMR for 13 organic matter isolates obtained from a variety of aquatic environments. SUVA, therefore, is shown to be a useful parameter for estimating the dissolved aromatic carbon content in aquatic systems. Experiments involving the reactivity of DOC with chlorine and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), however, show a wide range of reactivity for samples with similar SUVA values. These results indicate that, while SUVA measurements are good predictors of general chemical characteristics of DOC, they do not provide information about reactivity of DOC derived from different types of source materials. Sample pH, nitrate, and iron were found to influence SUVA measurements.},

With increasing numbers of PVI procedures, demand arises to reduce the cumulative fluoroscopic radiation exposure for both the physician and the patient. New technologies are emerging to address this issue. Here, we report our first experiences with a new fluoroscopy integrating technology in addition to a current 3D-mapping system. The new fluoroscopy integrating system (FIS) with 3D-mapping was used prospectively in 15 patients with AF. Control PVI cases (n = 37) were collected retrospectively as a complete series. Total procedure time (skin to skin), fluoroscopic time, and dose-area-product (DAP) data were analyzed. All PVI procedures were performed by one experienced physician using a commercially available circular multipolar irrigated ablation catheter. All PVI procedures were successfully undertaken without major complications. Baseline characteristics of the two groups showed no significant differences. In the group using the FIS, the fluoroscopic time and DAP were significantly reduced from 571 +/- 187 seconds versus 1011 +/- 527 seconds (P = 0.0029) and 4342 +/- 2073 cGycm(2) versus 6208 +/- 3314 cGycm(2) (P = 0.049), respectively. Mean procedure time was not significantly affected and was 114 +/- 31 minutes versus 104 +/- 24 minutes (P = 0.23) by the FIS.The use of the new FIS with the current 3D-mapping system enables a significant reduction of the total fluoroscopy time and DAP compared to the previous combination of 3D-mapping system plus normal fluoroscopy during PVI utilizing a circular multipolar irrigated ablation catheter. However, the concomitant total procedure time is not affected. Thus, the new system reduces the radiation exposure for both the physicians and patients.},

abstract = {Assessment of the quality of freshwater bodies is essential to determine the impact of human activities on water resources. The water quality status is estimated by comparing indicators with standard thresholds. Indicators are usually statistical criteria that are calculated on discrete measurements of water quality variables. If the time step of the measured time series is not sufficient to fully capture the variable's variability, the deduced indicator may not reflect the system's functioning. The goal of the present work is to assess, through a hydro-biogeochemical modeling approach, the optimal sampling frequency for an accurate estimation of 6 water quality indicators defined by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) in a large human-impacted river, which receives large urban effluents (the Seine River across the Paris urban area). The optimal frequency depends on the sampling location and on the monitored variable. For fast varying compounds that originate from urban effluents, such as PO43−, NH4+ and NO2−, a sampling time step of one week or less is necessary. To be able to reflect the highly transient character of bloom events, chl a concentrations also require a short monitoring time step. On the contrary, for variables that exert high seasonal variability, as NO3− and O 2, monthly sampling can be sufficient for an accurate estimation of WFD indicators in locations far enough from major effluents. Integrative water quality variables, such as O 2, can be highly sensitive to hydrological conditions. It would therefore be relevant to assess the quality of water bodies at a seasonal scale rather than at annual or pluri-annual scales. This study points out the possibility to develop smarter monitoring systems by coupling both time adaptative automated monitoring networks and modeling tools used as spatio-temporal interpolators.},

abstract = {Forests form the critical source water areas for downstream drinking water supplies in many parts of the world, including the Rocky Mountain regions of North America. Large scale natural disturbances from wildfire and severe insect infestation are more likely because of warming climate and can significantly impact water quality downstream of forested headwaters regions. To investigate potential implications of changing climate and wildfire on drinking water treatment, the 2003 Lost Creek Wildfire in Alberta, Canada was studied. Four years of comprehensive hydrology and water quality data from seven watersheds were evaluated and synthesized to assess the implications of wildfire and post-fire intervention (salvage-logging) on downstream drinking water treatment. The 95th percentile turbidity and DOC remained low in streams draining unburned watersheds (5.1 NTU, 3.8 mg/L), even during periods of potential treatment challenge (e.g., stormflows, spring freshet); in contrast, they were elevated in streams draining burned (15.3 NTU, 4.6 mg/L) and salvage-logged (18.8 NTU, 9.9 mg/L) watersheds. Persistent increases in these parameters and observed increases in other contaminants such as nutrients, heavy metals, and chlorophyll-a in discharge from burned and salvage-logged watersheds present important economic and operational challenges for water treatment; most notably, a potential increased dependence on solids and DOC removal processes. Many traditional source water protection strategies would fail to adequately identify and evaluate many of the significant wildfire- and post-fire management-associated implications to drinking water " treatability" ; accordingly, it is proposed that " source water supply and protection strategies" should be developed to consider a suppliers' ability to provide adequate quantities of potable water to meet demand by addressing all aspects of drinking water " supply" (i.e., quantity, timing of availability, and quality) and their relationship to " treatability" in response to land disturbance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Increasing concentrations of organic matter (OM) in surface waters have been noted over large parts of the boreal/nemoral zone in Europe and North America. This has raised questions about the causes and the likelihood of further increases. A number of drivers have been proposed, including temperature, hydrology, as well as SO42- and Cl- deposition. The data reported so far, however, have been insufficient to define the relative importance of different drivers in landscapes where they interact. Thirty-five years of monthly measurements of absorbance and chemical oxygen demand (COD), two common proxies for OM, from 28 large Scandinavian catchments provide an unprecedented opportunity to resolve the importance of hypothesized drivers. For 21 of the catchments, there are 18 years of total organic carbon (TOC) measurements as well. Despite the heterogeneity of the catchments with regards to climate, size and land use, there is a high degree of synchronicity in OM across the entire region. Rivers go from widespread trends of decreasing OM to increasing trends and back again three times in the 35-year record. This synchronicity in decadal scale oscillations and long-term trends suggest a common set of dominant OM drivers in these landscapes. Here, we use regression models to test the importance of different potential drivers. We show that flow and SO42- together can predict most of the interannual variability in OM proxies, up to 88{\%} for absorbance, up to 78{\%} for COD. Two other candidate drivers, air temperature and Cl-, add little explanatory value. Declines in anthropogenic SO42- since the mid-1970s are thus related to the observed OM increases in Scandinavia, but, in contrast to many recent studies, flow emerges as an even more important driver of OM variability. Stabilizing SO42- levels also mean that hydrology is likely to be the major driver of future variability and trends in OM. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils plays an important role in the biogeochemistry of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, in pedogenesis, and in the transport of pollutants in soils. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent literature about controls on DOM concentrations and fluxes in soils. We focus on comparing results between laboratory and field investigations and on the differences between the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP). Both laboratory and field studies show that litter and humus are the most important DOM sources in soils. However, it is impossible to quantify the individual contributions of each of these sources to DOM release. In addition, it is not clear how changes in the pool sizes of litter or humus may affect DOM release. High microbial activity, high fungal abundance, and any conditions that enhance mineralization all promote high DOM concentrations. However, under field conditions, hydrologic variability in soil horizons with high carbon contents may be more important than biotic controls. In subsoil horizons with low carbon contents, DOM may be adsorbed strongly to mineral surfaces, resulting in low DOM concentrations in the soil solution. There are strong indications that microbial degradation of DOM also controls the fate of DOM in the soil. Laboratory experiments on controls of DOM dynamics have often contradicted field observations, primarily because hydrology has not been taken into account. For example, laboratory findings on the effects of plant species (conifer vs. deciduous) on DOM release from forest floors and on the effects of substrate quality (e.g.: C/N ratio) or pH on DOC concentrations were often not confirmed in field studies. The high adsorption capacity of soil clay minerals and oxides for DOM shown in laboratory studies may not control the transport of DOM in soils in the field if macropore fluxes dominate under field conditions. Laboratory findings about the biodegradability of DOM also await verification under field conditions. Studies that include DON and DOP dynamics in addition to DOC are few. The rate of release and the fate of DOC, DON, and DOP in soils may differ to a far greater extent than previously assumed. Controls established for DOC might thus be not valid for DON and DOP. Despite intensive research in the last decade, our knowledge of the formation and fate of DOM in soils and its response to changing environmental conditions is still fragmented and often inconsistent. Predictions at the field scale are still very uncertain, and most of the information available today is the result of studies on temperate soils and forest ecosystems. Thus, future research on controls of DOM dynamics should be extended to soils under different land uses and in other climate zones. Emphasis should also be given to: (i) the effects of soil organic matter properties on the release of DOM (ii) environmental factors controlling DOM quantity and quality (iii) the assessment of biological versus physico-chemical controls on the release and retention of DOM in soils, and (iv) the differences between DOC, DON, and DOP. Finally, if our goal is to predict DOM concentrations and fluxes in soils, future research on the controls of DOM dynamics should have a strong focus on field studies.},

abstract = {Historical relationships between weather, the Canadian fire weather index (FWI) system components and area burned in Canadian ecozones were analysed on a monthly basis in tandem with output from the Canadian and the Hadley Centre GCMs to project future area burned. Temperature and fuel moisture were the variables best related to historical monthly area burned with 36-64{\%} of the variance explained depending on ecozone. Our results suggest significant increases in future area burned although there are large regional variations in fire activity. This was especially true for the Canadian GCM where some ecozones show little change in area burned, however area burned was not projected to decrease in any of the ecozones modelled. On average, area burned in Canada is projected to increase by 74-118{\%} by the end of this century in a 3 × CO2 scenario. These estimates do not explicitly take into account any changes in vegetation, ignitions, fire season length, and human activity (fire management and land use activities) that may influence area burned. However, the estimated increases in area burned would have significant ecological, economic and social impacts for Canada. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {Catchment dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes are governed by complex interactions, which control biogeochemical processes generating DOC and hydrological connectivity, facilitating transport through the landscape to streams. This paper presents the development of a coupled hydrological-biogeochemical model for a northern watershed with organic-rich soils, to simulate daily DOC concentrations. The parsimonious model design allows the relative importance of DOC fluxes from the major landscape units (e.g. hillslopes, groundwater and riparian saturation area) to be determined. The dynamic extent of the saturated riparian zone, which at maximum wetness comprised 40 {\%} of the drainage area, contributed 84 {\%} of DOC to the stream, of which 16 {\%} was derived from the hillslope soils. This shows the disproportional riparian influence on stream water chemistry and the importance of the non-linearity in hydrological connectivity. The temporal connectivity of each of the landscape units was dependent on antecedent moisture conditions, with highly transient connections between the hillslope and valley bottom saturated area, which were entirely disconnected during the driest periods. The groundwater contribution remained constant, but its relative importance increased during the driest periods. The study emphasises the importance of conceptualising hydrological connectivity and its relation to hydroclimatic factors, as well soil biogeochemical processes, when modelling stream water DOC.},

abstract = {Elevated concentration and high variance of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface waters are a challenge for the production of drinking water. Past studies have indicated a dominant role of wetlands in DOC mobilization, but have mainly been focused on boreal and oceanic catchments. Here we analyze the observational DOC time series from 89 temperate humid catchments which drain into German drinking water reservoirs. We characterize the DOC concentration median and variability and utilize partial least squares regression in order to quantify the relation to catchment characteristics such as land use, climate, and topography. We found that the long-term median DOC concentration in the catchment is well predicted by the 90th percentile of the distribution of the topographic wetness index (0.9P TWI) over the entire catchment area. The 0.9P TWI can be directly connected to the abundance of riparian wetlands in the catchments. DOC concentration variability (represented as the ratio of the interquartile range and the median concentrations) was also found to be well predictable. Concentration variability was highest in cold and wet catchments with a high 0.9P TWI. Here we also found stronger correlations between DOC concentrations and discharge, with positive concentration-discharge patterns. Catchments with elevated DOC-concentration variance also exhibited the most severe long-term increases in concentrations. Our results thus indicate that, in temperate climates, riparian wetlands can be the dominant source zones of DOC and control the hydrological mobilization and potentially also the spatial difference in long-term concentration trends observed in surface waters. We conclude that the dominance of topography and climatic conditions in controlling spatio-temporal patterns in DOC concentrations leads to very limited management options.},

abstract = {The relationship between stream water DOC concentrations and soil organic C pools was investigated at a range of spatial scales in subcatchments of the River Dee system in north-east Scotland. Catchment percentage peat cover and soil C pools, calculated using local, national and international soils databases, were related to mean DOC concentrations in streams draining small- ({\textless}5 km2), medium- (12-38 km2) and large-scale (56-150 km2) catchments. The results show that, whilst soil C pool is a good predictor of stream water DOC concentration at all three scales, the strongest relationships were found in the small-scale catchments. In addition, in both the small- and large-scale catchments, percentage peat cover was as a good predictor of stream water DOC concentration as catchment soil C pool. The data also showed that, for a given soil C pool, streams draining lowland ({\textless}700 m) catchments had higher DOC concentrations than those draining upland ({\textgreater}700 m) catchments, suggesting that disturbance and land use may have a small effect on DOC concentration. Our results therefore suggest that the relationship between stream water DOC concentration and catchment soil C pools exists at a range of spatial scales and this relationship appears to be sufficiently robust to be used to predict the effects of changes in catchment soil C storage on stream water DOC concentration.},

abstract = {The flux of terrestrial C to rivers has increased relative to preindustrial levels, a fraction of which is aged dissolved organic C (DOC). In rivers, C is stored in sediments, exported to the ocean, or (bio)chemically processed and released as CO2. Disturbance changes land cover and hydrology, shifting potential sources and processing of DOC. To investigate the likely sources of aged DOC, we analyzed radiocarbon ages, chemical, and spectral properties of DOC and major ions from 19 rivers draining the coterminous U.S. and Arctic. DOC optics indicated that the majority is exported as aromatic, high molecular weight, modern molecules while aged DOC tended to consist of smaller, microbial degradation products. Aged DOC exports, observed regularly in arid basins and during base flow in arctic rivers, are associated with higher proportion of mineral weathering products, suggesting deeper flows paths. These patterns also indicate potential for production of microbial byproducts as DOC ages in soil and water with longer periods of time between production and transport. Thus, changes in hydrology associated with landscape alteration (e.g., tilling or shifting climates) that can result in deeper flow paths or longer residence times will likely lead to a greater proportion of aged carbon in riverine exports.},

abstract = {Hillslope runoff was studied in a subarctic, subalpine environment to improve understanding of runoff generation processes and the mechanisms whereby water moves from hillslopes to the stream. Runoff characteristics of four hillslopes were examined between 1997 and 1999, each with distinct soils, frost, topography and vegetation. Lateral fluxes were confined to hillslopes with porous organic soils overlying less permeable mineral substrates, setting up a two-layer flow system whereby most drainage occurs as quickflow in the porous organic layer as matrix flow and/or as preferential flow in pipes, rills and interconnected surface depressions. During snowmelt, meltwater infiltrated and percolated the porous frozen organic layers with little resistance. Percolation ceased at the organic/mineral interface due to the impermeable nature of frozen mineral soils, forming a perched saturated zone and initiating runoff. Snowmelt runoff was greater on slopes with greater snow water equivalent and reduced organic layer thickness. In summer, runoff was greatest on slopes where wet conditions were sustained by inflow. Stormflow hydrographs responded rapidly to rainfall while exhibiting extended recessions compared with temperate regions. Where sustained inflow occurred, the recession limb showed two segments to reflect different source areas of stormflow production. Recession analysis was used to quantify contributing areas, which were highly variable and controlled largely by hillslope wetness and organic-layer properties. Results indicate that the concept of variable source area for runoff generation applies to subarctic, subalpine catchments.},

abstract = {As a result of global warming, the discharges from rivers in permafrost regions have varied significantly. However, its mechanism remains unclear. One of possible factors is active soil freeze-thaw cycle, which may influence surface runoff in the variation of permafrost water cycle processes. In this study, a typical permafrost watershed in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau was selected, its hydrological processes were monitored from 2004 to 2007, and the effects of the freezing and thawing depth of the soil active layer on runoff processes were assessed. The runoff modulus, runoff coefficient, direct runoff ratio, recession gradient and their seasonal variations were estimated and analyzed. The active soil dynamics and water budget were analyzed to prove the features of the surface runoff and the influences of active soil freeze-thaw processes. The primary factors influencing surface runoff processes during different seasons were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and statistical regression methods. The results showed that the high runoff coefficient and low direct runoff ratio were the main characteristics during the spring flood period (May-June) and during the autumn recession period (September). The runoff modulus and its year-to-year variability were the greatest in the summer flood period. The direct runoff ratio decreased from 0.43 in May to 0.29 in September, with the exception of the highest ratio, which occurred during the summer recession period (July). The active soil thawing in the upper layer of depth of 60 cm had contributed to increase in discharge, but the increase in thawing depth deeper than 60 cm led to a decrease in surface runoff and slowness in the recession process. Precipitation played a small role in the spring flood runoff and the autumn runoff. The soil active layer freeze-thaw variation, which affected seasonal soil water dynamic and water budget and reformed seasonal runoff characteristics, along with vegetation cover changes, is considered the potential major factor in control of the hydrological processes in the permafrost region. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In forested watersheds, the concentration, composition, and reactivity of DOM exported changes as baseflow transitions to storm flow, with major implications to downstream biogeochemistry. Hysteresis describes an observed difference between in-stream solute concentration/signal and discharge. By studying the relationship between DOM and stream discharge, we refine our understanding of the environmental and hydrological factors that influence the quantity and quality of stream DOM. The main objective of this study was to track hysteretic changes in riverine DOM molecular composition during storm events. Samples were collected from nested sites within the Passumpsic River catchment (Vermont, USA), a tributary of the Connecticut River. High-resolution monitoring of fluorescent DOM (via in situ sensors) and automated collection of discrete samples captured short-term, hydrologically driven variations in DOM concentration and composition. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed an enrichment in aliphatic compounds at storm onset, while aromatic and polyphenolic compounds were more enriched at peak discharge. Molecular hysteresis patterns were similar across stream orders, indicating that fresh, terrigenous DOM is quickly shunted downstream, through the river network, during pulses of high discharge.},

abstract = {The production of pyrogenic carbon (PyC; a continuum of organic carbon (C) ranging from partially charred biomass and charcoal to soot) is a widely acknowledged C sink, with the latest estimates indicating that {\~{}}50{\%} of the PyC produced by vegetation fires potentially sequesters C over centuries. Nevertheless, the quantitative importance of PyC in the global C balance remains contentious, and therefore, PyC is rarely considered in global C cycle and climate studies. Here we examine the robustness of existing evidence and identify the main research gaps in the production, fluxes and fate of PyC from vegetation fires. Much of the previous work on PyC production has focused on selected components of total PyC generated in vegetation fires, likely leading to underestimates. We suggest that global PyC production could be in the range of 116-385 Tg C yr-1, that is {\~{}}0.2-0.6{\%} of the annual terrestrial net primary production. According to our estimations, atmospheric emissions of soot/black C might be a smaller fraction of total PyC ({\textless}2{\%}) than previously reported. Research on the fate of PyC in the environment has mainly focused on its degradation pathways, and its accumulation and resilience either in situ (surface soils) or in ultimate sinks (marine sediments). Off-site transport, transformation and PyC storage in intermediate pools are often overlooked, which could explain the fate of a substantial fraction of the PyC mobilized annually. We propose new research directions addressing gaps in the global PyC cycle to fully understand the importance of the products of burning in global C cycle dynamics.},

Stream waters with similar dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in different climatic regions had distinctive DOM compositions, but shared 69.5 {\%} of the 3286 individual chemical formulae detected. DOM compositions common to all watersheds were characterized by abundant lignin-like and tannin-like molecules as well as carboxyl-rich alicyclic-like molecules (CRAM); 50 {\%} of all formulae were found in all streams. Of the roughly 700 unique chemical formulae within a given fluvial network, most were outside the CRAM region within a van Krevelen diagram and 78 to 95 {\%} were restricted to 1st-order streams where diffuse ground water sources surface, coalesce into a channel, and flow downstream.

abstract = {The hydrologic and biogeochemical responses of forested watersheds to inputs of rainfall and snowmelt can be an indicator of internal watershed function. In this study, we assess how the quantity and quality, both chemical and spectroscopic, of stream water DOC changes in response to a 6-day storm event during the wet season of 2003 in three small ({\textless}1 km2) basins in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon. The watersheds included one old-growth watershed (WS02) and two previously logged watersheds (WS01 and WS10). Prestorm concentrations of DOC ranged from 1.5 to 2.2 mg C L-1 in the three watersheds and increased approximately threefold on the ascending limb of the storm hydrograph. Concentrations of DOC were both highest in the unharvested, old-growth watershed. The specific UV absorbance (SUVA, 254 nm) of DOC in the three watersheds increased by 9 to 36{\%} during the storm, suggesting that DOC mobilized from catchment soils during storms is more aromatic than DOC entering the stream during baseflow. The increase in SUVA was most pronounced in the previously harvested catchments. Chromatographic fractionation of DOC showed that the percentage of DOC composed of non-humic material decreasing by 9 to 22{\%} during the storm. Shifts in the fluorescence properties of DOC suggest that there was not a pronounced change in the relative proportion of stream water DOC derived from allochthonous versus autochthonous precursor material. Taken together, these results suggest that spectroscopic and chemical characterization of DOC can be used as tools to investigate changing sources of DOC and water within forested watersheds.

abstract = {Accurate quantification of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface and soil pore waters is crucial for understanding changes in water resources under the influence of climate and land use changes. Sampling and laboratory analysis of DOC content at a sufficient temporal frequency are especially difficult to achieve for natural DOC sources like the extensive boreal and arctic mire landscapes due to their remoteness. Therefore, the goals of this paper are (1) to investigate the performance of a portable, high-resolution ultraviolet-visible light spectroscopic method for determining the DOC content of surface and soil pore water samples from a boreal mire complex and (2) to compare the spectroscopic method with other DOC measurement techniques, e.g., the wet heated persulfate oxidation method and a laboratory, expulsion-based spectrophotometric method and (3) to assess different multivariate models that relate absorbance measurements with DOC contents. The study indicates that high-resolution spectroscopic measurements provide a simple, robust and non-destructive method for measuring DOC content. These measurements are of short duration ({\&}{\#}60;1. min) and the sample analysis is portable, rendering this method particularly advantageous for in situ investigations at remote field locations. The study also demonstrates that if absorbances at specific wavelengths are used as proxies for DOC concentration, it is recommended to create site-specific calibration models that include more than one wavelength to achieve the optimal accuracy of the proxy-based DOC quantification.},

@article{Gingold2014,
abstract = {Fluoroscopy, or real-time projection X-ray imaging, has been in clinical use since shortly after Roentgen's discovery of X-rays. Early fluoroscopes consisted simply of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which the patient was placed. After passing through the patient, the remnant beam impinged upon the fluorescent screen and produced a visible glow, which was directly observed by the practitioner. In modern systems, the fluorescent screen is coupled to an electronic device that amplifies and transforms the glowing light into a video signal suitable for presentation on an electronic display. One benefit of the modern system compared to the earlier approach is that the fluoroscopist need not stand in close proximity to the fluorescent screen in order to observe the live image. This results in a substantial reduction in radiation dose to the fluoroscopist. Patients receive less radiation dose as well, because of the amplification and overall efficiency of the imaging system. Fluoroscopy differs from most other X-ray imaging in that the images produced appear in real-time, allowing evaluation of dynamic biological processes and guiding interventions. Electronic fluoroscopy systems create this perception by capturing and displaying images at a high frame rate, typically 25 or 30 frames per second. At these frame rates, the human visual system cannot distinguish frame-to-frame variation and motion appears to be continuous, without visible flicker. To achieve high frame rates while keeping cumulative radiation dose to a reasonable level, the radiation dose to the image receptor per image (i.e., per frame) must be kept quite low, about 0.1{\%} of the dose used in radiography. Fluoroscopic images appear with an inverted grayscale (black/white is reversed) compared with standard radiographs. This convention is derivative of the appearance of the early non-intensified fluoroscopic screens, and it has been retained in the digital age even though the capability now exists to digitally reverse the grayscale.},

abstract = {Information on water quality, in particular on sediment, phosphorus and nitrogen exports from catchments, is required by catchment managers and other stakeholder groups to determine appropriate management options for water quality issues. However intensive spatial and temporal data on concentrations or loads of these nutrients is relatively scarce. Given this constraint, nutrient export models which can provide useful information on nutrient loads with only sparse data inputs are required. In addition, more complex physics and conceptually based models which are commonly available worldwide are often inappropriate for predicting loads in catchments. Consequently, models of a simpler conceptual and/or empirical type are used where input data are sparse and key processes are catchment dependent. This paper compares four such models (CMSS, AQUALM, Moss model and IHACRES-WQ) and several methods based on direct estimation for their ability to predict loads in Australian catchment situations. The implications of the limited available input data sets for load prediction in Australian catchments are discussed. In particular the importance of coordinated data collection over longer time periods and sufficiently fine temporal scales, covering a broad range of event sizes, is emphasised. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Streams and rivers are important pathways for the export of atmospherically deposited mercury (Hg) from watersheds. Dissolved Hg (HgD) is strongly associated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream water, but the ratio of HgD to DOC is highly variable between watersheds. In this study, the HgD:DOC ratios from 19 watersheds were evaluated with respect to Hg wet deposition and watershed soil organic carbon (SOC) content. On a subset of sites where data were available, DOC quality measured by specific ultra violet absorbance at 254 nm, was considered as an additional factor that may influence HgD:DOC . No significant relationship was found between Hg wet deposition and HgD:DOC, but SOC content (g m22) was able to explain 81{\%} of the variance in the HgD:DOC ratio (ng mg21) following the form: HgD:DOC517.8*SOC20.41. The inclusion of DOC quality as a secondary predictor variable explained only an additional 1{\%} of the variance. A mathematical framework to interpret the observed power-law relationship between HgD:DOC and SOC suggests Hg supply limitation for adsorption to soils with relatively large carbon pools. With SOC as a primary factor controlling the association of HgD with DOC, SOC data sets may be utilized to predict stream HgD:DOC ratios on a more geographically widespread basis. In watersheds where DOC data are available, estimates of HgD may be readily obtained. Future Hg emissions policies must consider soil-mediated processes that affect the transport of Hg and DOC from terrestrial watersheds to streams for accurate predictions of water quality impacts.},

However, spatially explicit and temporally resolved data sets can be difficult to analyze using classical statistical methods because the data are typically autocorrelated and thus violate the assumption of independence. Here, we describe the synchrony package for the R programming environment, which provides modern parametric and nonparametric methods for (i) quantifying temporal and spatial patterns of auto- and cross-correlated variability in univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data sets, and (ii) assessing their statistical significance via Monte Carlo randomizations. We illustrate how the methods included in the package can be used to investigate the causes of spatial and temporal variability in ecological systems through a series of examples, and discuss the assumptions and caveats of each statistical procedure in order to provide a practical guide for their application in the real world. {\textcopyright} 2014 British Ecological Society.},

The objectives of this study are to determine if relationships can be developed between differential UV absorbance and DBP concentrations, for both regulated and unregulated DBPs, in a full-scale facility and to determine if these relationships vary throughout the year with variations in raw water quality and treatment conditions. The results show that linear and power relationships between differential UV absorbance and DBP concentrations can be developed (0.62 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.99), although differences between relationships obtained in lab- and full-scale conditions need further investigation. Finally, the relationships obtained are different from one sampling campaign to another, which raises the question of whether it is possible to determine relationships that are stable enough to be used as adequate feedback on DBP concentrations.},

abstract = {A rapid and effective detection method is essential for water utilities to monitor variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in source waters in order to apply strategies to minimize formation of disinfection by-products in treated waters. Ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UVA254) and specific UVA254 (SUVA254) have been widely used as surrogates of concentration and reactivity of DOC, respectively. However, poor correlations between SUVA254 and specific trihalomethane formation potential (STHMFP) have been occasionally reported and the reliability of using SUVA 254 to predict trihalomethane (THM) formation has been questioned. In this study, the correlations of SUVA254 and THM reactivity of three different DOC sources commonly found in water treatment facilities (aquatic carbon, soil carbon, and fecal matter) were evaluated. A 0.22 $\mu$m filter, instead of 0.45 $\mu$m filter, was used for water filtration to minimize the effects of colloidal materials on UVA254. UVA254 and DOC after chlorination were also examined and differential UVA254 and SUVA254 ($\Delta$SUVA254) were compared to THM reactivity. Results showed correlations between UVA254 and DOC were source dependent suggesting natural humification and degradation processes did not alter DOC characteristics from its original sources. The STHMFP of river and soil DOC samples were comparable, whereas their UVA254 normalized THMFP were different (p {\textless} 0.05), suggesting that UVA254 is a better indicator in predicting THM formation potential than DOC concentrations. $\Delta$SUVA254 showed a stronger correlation with STHMFP than the conventional surrogate - SUVA254. {\textcopyright} IWA Publishing 2008.},

abstract = {The random forest algorithm, proposed by L. Breiman in 2001, has been extremely successful as a general-purpose classification and regression method. The approach, which combines several randomized decision trees and aggregates their predictions by averaging, has shown excellent performance in settings where the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations. Moreover, it is versatile enough to be applied to large-scale problems, is easily adapted to various ad hoc learning tasks, and returns measures of variable importance. The present article reviews the most recent theoretical and methodological developments for random forests. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical forces driving the algorithm, with special attention given to the selection of parameters, the resampling mechanism, and variable importance measures. This review is intended to provide non-experts easy access to the main ideas.},

abstract = {UV254 and SUVA254 determinations are used in water treatment to obtain information about the nature of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in water samples. This article presents new information about obtaining accurate results for UV254 and SUVA254 (the ratio of UV254 to the concentration of DOC in the water) in freshwater samples. Although the potential impact of colloidal materials on UV 254 results is mentioned in standard and US Environmental Protection Agency methods, these methods provide no clear guidance for validating such measurements. The main objectives of this research were to examine the effects of colloidal and particulate matter in freshwaters on DOC and UV 254determinations and to develop some guidelines for filtering freshwater samples with widely varying turbidities. The experimental results showed that the water sample turbidity level and characteristics as well as the nature of the membrane filter pore structures and pore size distribution play important roles in UV254 and SUVA254 determinations. Measuring turbidity in the sample filtrate was a simple way to validate UV 254 and SUVA254 results. The findings of this study will help the water treatment industry obtain more reliable UV254 and SUVA254 results and assist in developing improved experimental protocols. - RS.},

Different statistics have been used as measures of synchrony, and various techniques have been employed to test the hypothesis that there is no synchrony. In this paper we first describe and contrast various measures of synchrony and then discuss testing for no synchrony. Tests that ignore the serial correlation are commonly employed but are incorrect if there is serial correlation present, as is often the case with populations followed over time. Alternative approaches and their limitations are presented including tests based on residuals, adjusted degrees of freedom tests, and bootstrap procedures. We recommend tests based on residuals in a model-based setting. We also discuss some of the difficulties of finding model-free approaches and suggest some methods based on confidence intervals for future study.},

The results showed that AlD, CuD, and ZnD were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) higher in stormflow events than in baseflow, while in SS, all metal concentrations decreased (p {\textless} 0.05) during stormflow events. The metal seasonal variability was also examined. In dissolved form, only FeD showed significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) between seasons, with higher concentrations in summer, independently of the hydrological conditions, while in SS, only CuSS during stormflow events showed concentrations significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.05) during summer than in the remainder seasons. The partition coefficients (K D) decreased significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) for all metals during stormflow events. K D correlations showed that SS and DOC were the main factors in controlling the K D of all metals, except the K D of Mn which did not depend on any of these variables in baseflow.

The objectives were to examine C–Q relationships constructed from high-resolution time series of flow, temperature, pH, conductivity, nitrate and turbidity, and their implications for hydrological processes. High-resolution datasets from the quality assured records of the Rothamsted Research North Wyke Farm Platform in the UK were examined using a graphical method and cross-correlation statistics. The study found that storm events based C–Q hysteresis reflects the cross-correlation that is generally hidden in time series analysis of large datasets, and that although Q and water quality variables can be effectively influenced by catchment size, the C–Q relationship is less significantly influenced. The dominant C–Q relationships of the water variables in the study area reflect that saturated overland flow was prevalent during the study period in the catchments, while the CCF results indicate coupled transfer of sediments and solute in the area at lag ≥ 0.

abstract = {The solution chemistry of forested streams primarily in western North America is explained by considering the major factors that influence this chemistry-geological weathering; atmospheric precipitation and climate; precipitation acidity; terrestrial biological processes; physical/chemical reactions in the soil; and physical, chemical, and biological processes within streams. Due to the complexity of all these processes and their varying importance for different chemicals, stream water chemistry has exhibited considerable geographic and temporal variation and is difficult to model accurately. The impacts of forest harvesting on stream water chemistry were reviewed by considering the effects of harvesting on each of the important factors controlling this chemistry, as well as other factors influencing these impacts - extent of the watershed harvested, presence of buffer strips between streams and harvested areas, nature of post-harvesting site preparation, revegetation rate following harvesting, pre-harvesting soil fertility, and soil buffering capacity. These effects have sometimes reinforced one another but have sometimes been counterbalancing or slight so that harvesting impacts on stream water chemistry have been highly variable. Eight major knowledge gaps were identified, two of which - a scarcity of detailed stream chemical budgets and knowledge of longitudinal variation in stream chemistry - relate to undisturbed streams, while the remainder relate to forest harvesting effects.},

abstract = {Understanding how water and solutes enter and propagate through freshwater landscapes in the Anthropocene is critical to protecting and restoring aquatic ecosystems and ensuring human water security. However, high hydrochemical variability in headwater streams, where most carbon and nutrients enter river networks, has hindered effective modelling and management. We developed an analytical framework informed by landscape ecology and catchment hydrology to quantify spatiotemporal variability across scales, which we tested in 56 headwater catchments, sampled periodically over 12 years in western France. Unexpectedly, temporal variability in dissolved carbon, nutrients and major ions was preserved moving downstream and spatial patterns of water chemistry were stable on annual to decadal timescales, partly because of synchronous variation in solute concentrations. These findings suggest that while concentration and flux cannot be extrapolated among subcatchments, periodic sampling of headwaters provides valuable information about solute sources and subcatchment resilience to disturbance.},

abstract = {Expansion of the hydrologically connected area during rainfall events causes previously disconnected areas to contribute to streamflow. If these newly contributing areas have a different hydrochemical composition compared to the previously connected contributing areas, this may cause a change in stream water chemistry that cannot be explained by simple mixing of rainfall and baseflow. Changes in stormflow composition are, therefore, sometimes used to identify when transiently connected areas (or water sources) contribute to stormflow.We identified the dominant sources of streamflow for a steep 20 ha pre-Alpine headwater catchment in Switzerland and investigated the temporal changes in connectivity for four rainfall events based on stream water concentrations and groundwater level data. First, we compared the isotopic and chemical composition of stormflow at the catchment outlet to the composition of rainfall, groundwater and soil water. Three-component end-member mixing analyses indicated that groundwater dominated stormflow during all events, and that soil water fractions were minimal for three of the four events. However, the large variability in soil and groundwater composition compared to the temporal changes in stormflow composition inhibited the determination of the contributions from the different groundwater sources. Second, we estimated the concentrations of different solutes in stormflow based on the mixing fractions derived from twocomponent hydrograph separation using a conservative tracer (-2H) and the measured concentrations of the solutes in baseflow and rainfall. The estimated concentrations differed from the measured stormflow concentrations for many solutes and samples. The deviations increased gradually with increasing streamflow for some solutes (e.g. iron and copper), suggesting increased contributions from riparian and hillslope groundwater with higher concentrations of these solutes and thus increased hydrological connectivity. The findings of this study show that solute concentrations partly reflect the gradual changes in hydrologic connectivity, and that it is important to quantify the variability in the composition of different source areas.},

abstract = {We investigated potential source areas of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in headwater streams by examining DOC concentrations in lysimeter, shallow well, and stream water samples from a ref- erence catchment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. These observations were then compared to high-frequency temporal variations in fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) at the catchment outlet and the predicted spatial extent of shallow groundwater in soils throughout the catchment. While near-stream soils are generally considered a DOC source in forested catchments, DOC concentrations in near-stream groundwater were low (mean52.4 mg/L, standard error50.6 mg/L), less than hillslope groundwater farther from the channel (mean55.7 mg/L, standard error50.4 mg/L). Furthermore, water tables in near-stream soils did not rise into the carbon-rich upper B or O horizons even during events. In contrast, soils below bedrock outcrops near channel heads where lateral soil formation processes dominate had much higher DOC concentrations. Soils immediately downslope of bedrock areas had thick eluvial hori- zons indicative of leaching of organic materials, Fe, and Al and had similarly high DOC concentrations in groundwater (mean514.5 mg/L, standard error50.8 mg/L). Flow from bedrock outcrops partially covered by organic soil horizons produced the highest groundwater DOC concentrations (mean520.0 mg/L, stand- ard error54.6 mg/L) measured in the catchment. Correspondingly, stream water in channel heads sourced in part by shallow soils and bedrock outcrops had the highest stream DOC concentrations measured in the catchment. Variation in FDOM concentrations at the catchment outlet followed water table fluctuations in shallow to bedrock soils near channel heads. We show that shallow hillslope soils receiving runoff from organic matter-covered bedrock outcrops may be a major source of DOC in headwater catchments in for- ested mountainous regions where catchments have exposed or shallow bedrock near channel heads.},

Although many factors have been identified as influencing DOM fluxes and biochemical quality in rivers with varying land cover types, controls on DOM composition in forested headwater catchments of the western U.S. are poorly understood. This study examined the effect of hydrologic patterns and forest management history on stream DOM chemistry at watersheds located in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest of the Oregon Cascades. Specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254), generally indicative of aromaticity, increased in streams during storms with increasing surficial soil horizon and litter DOM inputs. Fluorescence excitation and emission matrices (EEMs) with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) identified a protein-like DOM fluorescent component as well as several other components associated with terrestrial plant material. Correlation analysis between the protein-like DOM component and hydrologic patterns, SUVA254, and DOC concentrations suggest that DOM during dry seasons represents more microbially-processed sources, such as protein-rich, deeper soil or DOM with greater in-stream microbial processing, compared to more plant-like surface soil sources observed during high flow. The base flow index (the proportion of base flow to total flow) showed a high correlation with the relative proportion of protein-like DOM indicating that deep soil water is a source of the protein-like signal. The relative proportions of the protein-like DOM and humic DOM were also influenced by the abundance of coarse woody debris (CWD), but not live tree biomass, with the proportions of protein-like DOM highest in harvested watersheds with low surficial CWD. This study shows UV and fluorescent spectroscopy is a viable finger printing method to elucidate DOM sources in pristine headwater streams at the western Cascades of Oregon.},

abstract = {Dimensionality problems in design of water quality networks arise from the multiple variables measured, which may be generated by different physical, chemical, and biological processes, and from the multiple spatial and temporal dimensions of the processes generating the measurements. The problem is further complicated by the range of objectives which a network may be required to meet. The designer is almost inevitably constrained by budget considerations to employ the same network to measure an array of variables, often for more than one objective. These considerations serve to pose serious difficulties in arriving at an analytical formulation of the problem, far less to solve it, with the result that almost all existing water quality networks have been designed on an ad hoc basis. Although no one approach is likely to be universally applicable, several techniques have been employed in particular situations. Included are state estimation, time series analysis, probability theory, and the theory of regionalized variables. Several promising applications of these techniques to water quality network design are reviewed, and suggestions for future research directions are advanced.

abstract = {Isotope hydrograph separation (IHS) is a valuable tool to study runoff generation processes. To perform an IHS, samples of baseflow (pre-event water) and streamflow are taken at the catchment outlet. For rainfall (event water) either a bulk sample is collected or it is sampled sequentially during the event. For small headwater catchment studies, event water samples are usually taken at only one sampling location in or near the catchment because the spatial variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall is assumed to be small. However, few studies have tested this assumption. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall and its effects on IHS results using detailed measurements from a small pre-alpine headwater catchment in Switzerland. Rainfall was sampled sequentially at eight locations across the 4.3 km 2 Zw{\"{a}}ckentobel catchment and stream water was collected in three subcatchments (0.15, 0.23, and 0.70 km 2 ) during ten events. The spatial variability in rainfall amount, average and maximum rainfall intensity and the isotopic composition of rainfall was different for each event. There was no significant relation between the isotopic composition of rainfall and total rainfall amount, rainfall intensity or elevation. For eight of the ten studied events the temporal variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall was larger than the spatial variability in the rainfall isotopic composition. The isotope hydrograph separation results, using only one rain sampler, varied considerably depending on which rain sampler was used to represent the isotopic composition of event water. The calculated minimum pre-event water contributions differed up to 60{\%}. The differences were particularly large for events with a large spatial variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall and a small difference between the event and pre-event water isotopic composition. Our results demonstrate that even in small catchments the spatial variability in the rainfall isotopic composition can be significant and has to be considered for IHS studies. Using data from only one rain sampler can result in significant errors in the estimated pre-event water contributions to streamflow.},

However, existing applications are generally restricted to the implementation of Breiman's original algorithm for regression and classification problems, while numerous developments could be also useful in solving diverse practical problems in the water sector. Here we popularize RF and their variants for the practicing water scientist, and discuss related concepts and techniques, which have received less attention from the water science and hydrologic communities. In doing so, we review RF applications in water resources, highlight the potential of the original algorithm and its variants, and assess the degree of RF exploitation in a diverse range of applications. Relevant implementations of random forests, as well as related concepts and techniques in the R programming language, are also covered. Keywords:},

abstract = {There is a lack of knowledge about how to quantify runoff generation and the hydrological processes operating in permafrost catchments on semi-arid plateaus. To understand how freeze-thaw cycles affect runoff generation processes in permafrost catchments, a typical headwater catchment with continuous permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau was measured. A new approach is presented in this study to account for runoff processes on the spring thawing period and autumn freezing period, when runoff generation clearly differs from that of non-permafrost catchments. This approach introduces a soil temperature-based water saturation function and modifies the soil water storage curve with a soil temperature threshold. The results show that surface soil thawing induced saturation excess runoff and subsurface interflow account for approximately 66–86{\%} and 14–34{\%} of total spring runoff, respectively, and the soil temperature significantly affects the runoff generation pattern, the runoff composition and the runoff coefficient with the enlargement of the active layer. The suprapermafrost groundwater discharge decreases exponentially with active layer frozen processes during autumn runoff recession, whereas the ratio of groundwater discharge to total runoff and the direct surface runoff coefficient simultaneously increase. The bidirectional freezing of the active layer controls and changes the autumn runoff processes and runoff composition. The new approach could be used to further develop hydrological models of cold regions dominated by permafrost.},

abstract = {Water quality studies require field data for assessment and mathematical simulation. Manual collection of water samples during floodsin small rivers is very difficult due to the short event duration and quick response to rainfall. Some low cost siphon samplers presented in the literature have been developed and adapted to collect event-based samples, but they only collect samples when the stream stage is rising. This work presents a new design of a low cost siphon sampler developed to allow collection when the stream stage is decreasing. It was tested in the laboratory and also installed in a river with flood flows strongly dominated by urban runoff. The major problem faced inthe field work was to keep the samplers in place due to the amount of debris carried by the floods. Laboratory tests showed water intrusion into the sampler during the rising stage and further improvement is proposed to solve the problem. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 IAHS Press.},

The Leech River Complex is fault-bounded between the Eocene Metchosin Igneous Com- plex to the south (part of the Crescent Terrane) and the Paleozoic to Jurassic Wrangel Terrane to the north and provides critical information on the evolution of the central part of the western North American forearc in Cretaceous through Eocene time. Sin- gle detrital zircons from the metasedimentary component, known as the Leech River Schist, give U-Pb interpreted ages that range from Precambrian to ca. 103 Ma, indi- cating a varied source region and a probable Early Cretaceous depositional age. U-Pb geochronology and fi eld investigations indicate at least two magmatic-metamorphic events in the Leech River Complex: one during the Late Cretaceous, and the other during the early Middle Eocene. The peraluminous Jordan River metagranodiorite, a fi ne-grained biotitic stock and related dikes intruded the Leech River Complex at ca. 88 Ma, during the older magmatic event. Metamorphic pressure-temperature conditions of 525–550 °C and 2–3 kbar are recorded in the contact aureole. The later event occurred during emplacement of the Walker Creek intrusions, a suite of per- aluminous tonalite, trondjhemite, and granodiorite dikes that intruded the Complex at ca. 51 Ma and produced a similar metamorphic aureole.

abstract = {Wildfire increases the likelihood of runoff, erosion, and downstream sedimentation in many of the watersheds that supply water for Colorado's Front Range communities. The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify rainfall intensity thresholds for a post-fire runoff or sediment delivery response at plots (≤0.06 ha), hillslopes (0.07–5.2 ha) and watersheds (100–1500 ha) after three Colorado Front Range wildfires for up to four years post-fire; (2) determine how the rainfall thresholds varied by fire location, year post-fire, spatial scale, and mulch treatments; and (3) use long-term rainfall data to map the likely frequency of rainfall events above these intensity thresholds as an indicator of risk for post-fire runoff or sediment delivery from future high severity fires in Colorado. Maximum 60-min rainfall intensity (MI60) thresholds were identified as the values that best separated rain storms that generated responses from those that did not. We found that thresholds did not significantly differ among fires for any year post-fire. Thresholds did significantly vary among spatial scales; for the first two years post-fire, high-confidence thresholds ranged from 4 to 8 mm h−1 across unmulched plots, hillslopes and watersheds. Compared to post-fire year 0, thresholds in year 3 were significantly higher, with high-confidence thresholds up to 22 mm h−1. NOAA Atlas rainfall data were used to compute and map frequencies of threshold exceedance across Colorado. Within the Front Range study area, rain storms with MI60 of 4 mm h−1 have frequencies ranging from 5 to 11 times per summer, while MI60 values of 8 mm h−1 have frequencies of 2–5 times per summer. Maps of threshold exceedance frequency can help identify areas most vulnerable to post-fire runoff and sediment delivery and prioritize post-fire emergency planning.},

abstract = {Leaves and needles are an important energy source for streams. However, relatively little is known about factors that determine width of the area contributing litter to streams. We assessed the relative effect of wind speed, wind direction, litter type, tree height and riparian topography on litter delivery to streams. Wind speed effect on litter travel distance was determined by releasing needles (Douglas-fir) and leaves (red alder) from mature and young tree canopies over a range of wind velocities. Short-term litter collections were conducted to determine the effect of wind speed on litter fall. Litter travel distance increased with increasing wind speed and increasing tree height. At low wind speeds leaves traveled further than needles. Litter fall increased with wind speed. These relationships were combined with literature values for seasonal rates of litter production and an annual wind speed and direction record from a riparian area in western Washington to evaluate the relative effect of various factors on litter delivery area width. We found that width of the contributing area for needles was about 35{\%} greater in riparian stands supporting mature conifer trees than at sites with young trees. Increasing riparian area slope from 0° to 45° increased width of contributing area by 71-95{\%}, depending on litter type and stand age. Doubling measured wind speed increased contribution zone width 67-82{\%}. Estimated buffer width required to capture 95{\%} of annual litter input ranged from about 14 m to over 25 m under the conditions which we evaluated. The variety of factors influencing litter delivery area width and the spatial and temporal variation in these factors indicates that the common practice of employing fixed-width buffers to protect stream-riparian interactions cannot be consistently effective.},

abstract = {The Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality are established by the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Drinking Water (CDW) and published by Health Canada. This summary table is updated regularly and published on Health Canada's website (www.healthcanada.gc.ca/waterquality). It supersedes all previous electronic and printed versions, including the 6th edition of the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality (1996). Each guideline was established based on current, published scientific research related to health effects, aesthetic effects, and operational considerations. Health-based guidelines are established on the basis of comprehensive review of the known health effects associated with each contaminant, on exposure levels and on the availability of treatment and analytical technologies. Aesthetic effects (e.g., taste, odour) are taken into account when these play a role in determining whether consumers will consider the water drinkable. Operational considerations are factored in when the presence of a substance may interfere with or impair a treatment process or technology (e.g., turbidity interfering with chlorination or UV disinfection) or adversely affect drinking water infrastructure (e.g., corrosion of pipes). The Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Drinking Water establishes the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality specifically for contaminants that meet all of the following criteria: 1. exposure to the contaminant could lead to adverse health effects in humans; 2. the contaminant is frequently detected or could be expected to be found in a large number of drinking water supplies throughout Canada; and 3. the contaminant is detected, or could be expected to be detected, in drinking water at a level that is of possible human health significance. If a contaminant of interest does not meet all these criteria, CDW may choose not to establish a numerical guideline or develop a Guideline Technical Document. In that case, a Guidance Document may be developed. Older guidelines are systematically reviewed in order to assess the need to update them; in the tables, guidelines that have been reaffirmed include both the original approval and reaffirmation year indicated after the name of the parameter. Science-based documents published as part of the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality (i.e., Guideline Technical Documents, Guidance Documents) are developed through a documented process which includes a literature review, internal and external peer-reviews, public consultations and Federal-Provincial-Territorial approval processes. For more information on specific guidelines, please refer to the guideline technical document or guidance document for the parameter of concern, available on the Health Canada website (www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/water-eau/index-eng.php).},

abstract = {The fate and transport of mercury (Hg) deposited on forested upland soils depends on the biogeo- chemical and hydrological processes occurring in the soil landscape. In this study, total Hg (THg) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were measured in streamwater from a 7.75 ha upland subcatchment of the METAALICUS watershed in northwestern Ontario, Canada. THg and DOC concentration-discharge rela- tionships were examined at the seasonal-scale and event-scale to assess the role of antecedent moisture conditions on the mobilization of these solutes to receiving waters. At the seasonal-scale, subcatchment discharge poorly explained THg and DOC concentration dynamics; however, the inclusion of antecedent water storage and precipitation metrics in a multiple regression model improved the prediction of THg and DOC concentrations significantly. At the event-scale, a comparison of THg and DOC concentrations for two small summer storms with similar total discharge showed that the storm following the wet snow- melt period had a significantly lower total flux of THg and DOC than the storm following warm and dry conditions in late summer due to a distinct shift in the concentration-discharge relationship. Measure- ments of soil water and groundwater THg and DOC concentrations, as well as a three-component mixing analysis, suggest that there was an accumulation of potentially-mobile DOC-bound THg in the well- humified organic soil layer in the catchment during the warm and dry summer period and that as the catchment became wetter in the autumn, there was an increase in soil water THg and DOC concentra- tions and these solutes were subsequently flushed during the autumn storm.

We deployed three high‐frequency (15 min) in situ absorbance spectrophotometers to monitor DOC and nitrate concentration for 126 storms in three watersheds with agricultural, urban, and forested land use/land cover. We examined intrastorm hysteresis and the influences of seasonality, storm size, and dominant land use/land cover on storm DOC and nitrate loads. DOC hysteresis was generally anticlockwise at all sites, indicating distal and plentiful sources for all three streams despite varied DOC character and sources. Nitrate hysteresis was generally clockwise for urban and forested sites, but anticlockwise for the agricultural site, indicating an exhaustible, proximal source of nitrate in the urban and forested sites, and more distal and plentiful sources of nitrate in the agricultural site. The agricultural site had significantly higher storm nitrate yield per water yield and higher storm DOC yield per water yield than the urban or forested sites. Seasonal effects were important for storm nitrate yield in all three watersheds and farm management practices likely caused complex interactions with seasonality at the agricultural site. Hysteresis indices did not improve predictions of storm nitrate yields at any site. We discuss key lessons from using high‐frequency in situ optical sensors.},

abstract = {There is a growing awareness that mid-to-high latitude regions will be strongly affected by climate change. These changes are predicted to be especially pronounced during winter, particularly at higher latitudes. To test how water quality in northern catchments could be affected by warmer winter climates, we assembled long-term data from eight well-studied catchments in Sweden, Scotland, Canada and the USA across a climatic gradient spanning from -2 to +9°C in mean annual temperature and between -11.6 and +6.1°C in average winter temperature. We used the climatic gradient combined with inter-annual variability among catchments to examine how warmer winters could affect the seasonality (seasonal timing) and synchroneity (coupling) of water and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes. In general, sites with colder winters (less than -5°C) experienced an export concentrated in spring, whereas sites with warmer winters ({\textgreater}0°C) displayed a more evenly distributed export across all seasons. Catchments with warmer winters also displayed less synchroneity between water and DOC flux during winter compared with colder sites, whereas the opposite was found for the spring. Patterns from the climatic gradient were supported by inter-annual variability at individual sites where both seasonality and synchroneity in the spring were related to the temperature during the preceding winter. Our findings suggest that one likely consequence of warmer winters in northern regions is that the proportion of the annual DOC and water export will increase during winter and decrease during spring and summer. This is of importance as it is the latter seasons during which downstream utilization of both water and DOC often is largest. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The number- and weight-averaged molecular weights of different isolated humic fractions and unfractionated organic matter from natural water samples were measured using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The chromatograms obtained, with sodium acetate as the mobile phase on a TSK G3000SW high-speed column, provided illustrative information about the nature of the dissolved organic matter that was not available with phosphate buffer eluents. The calibration of the column system merely with protein standards generated misleading information about the molecular weight and size distribution of humic solutes. Instead, the present results support the utilization of polystyrene-sulphonates (PSS) either alone or together with certain other model compounds for the calibration of HPSEC in studying molecular weights of humic solutes. The data obtained with the HPSEC system indicate that the average molecular weight of humic solutes is distinctly lower than is generally assumed. Besides, aquatic humic solutes also contain some very large-sized though minor constituents, leading to a fairly polydisperse mixture. Number-averaged molecular weights obtained using the HPSEC system were 4-5-fold greater than those from vapour-pressure osmometry. Bulk spectroscopic properties such as molar absorptivity at 280 nm and the quotient, E2/E3, correlated strongly with the total aromaticity and averaged molecular weights of all the humic solutes. This observation suggests that bulk spectroscopic properties can be applied, as a first approximation, for estimating the size of humic solutes and their aromaticity in natural surface waters.},

abstract = {C cycling and dissolved organic C (DOC) inputs to boreal aquatic systems probably will change substantially with climate change. DOC concentrations already are increasing in surface waters. Terrestrial C is a major source of C to boreal freshwater ecosystems, but the interface between these 2 ecosystems, the riparian zone, has not been studied often. To improve our understanding of the importance of terrestrial inputs of DOC to aquatic systems from surrounding forests, we followed the changes of DOC concentration along a continuum of precipitation, throughfall, soil water, ground water, lake, and brook water in a pristine, boreal, forested headwater catchment and developed a lake C balance based on terrestrial and lacustrine C fluxes. We also examined DOC quality changes using the ratio of absorbance at 465 and 665 nm (E4/E6). DOC concentrations increased from 2.4 mg/L in precipitation to 132.3 mg/L in soil water as water passed through the terrestrial ecosystem. DOC concentrations in the riparian zone were correlated with DOC concentrations in the adjacent outflowing brook but not in the headwater lake. E4/E6 ratios indicated that the DOC in precipitation and throughfall was dominated by higher molecular weight compounds and that the DOC in soil and ground water was dominated by lower molecular weight compounds. The input of terrestrial DOC to the aquatic ecosystem was estimated to be 5 to 13 g C m-2 y-1, which is small compared with the C fluxes between atmosphere and vegetation, but can significantly decrease the net ecosystem exchange of an old-growth forest catchment. Terrestrial DOC was a major source of C in the lake, rendering it heterotrophic. The DOC export (3 g DOC m-2 y-1) made up almost 70{\%} of total C export.},

abstract = {While much of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within rivers is destined for mineralization to CO2, a substantial fraction of riverine bicarbonate (HCO3−) flux represents a CO2 sink, as a result of weathering processes that sequester CO2 as HCO3−. We explored landscape-level controls on DOC and HCO3− flux in subcatchments of the boreal, with a specific focus on the effect of permafrost on riverine dissolved C flux. To do this, we undertook a multivariate analysis that partitioned the variance attributable to known, key regulators of dissolved C flux (runoff, lithology, and vegetation) prior to examining the effect of permafrost, using riverine biogeochemistry data from a suite of subcatchments drawn from the Mackenzie, Yukon, East, and West Siberian regions of the circumboreal. Across the diverse catchments that we study, controls on HCO3−flux were near-universal: runoff and an increased carbonate rock contribution to weathering (assessed as riverwater Ca:Na) increased HCO3− yields, while increasing permafrost extent was associated with decreases in HCO3−. In contrast, permafrost had contrasting and region-specific effects on DOC yield, even after the variation caused by other key drivers of its flux had been accounted for. We used ionic ratios and SO4 yields to calculate the potential range of CO2sequestered via weathering across these boreal subcatchments, and show that decreasing permafrost extent is associated with increases in weathering-mediated CO2 fixation across broad spatial scales, an effect that could counterbalance some of the organic C mineralization that is predicted with declining permafrost.},

abstract = {Understanding of the processes that control CO2 concentrations in the aquatic environment has been hampered by the absence of a direct method to make continuous measurements over both short- and long-term time intervals. We describe an in situ method in which a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor is enclosed in a water impermeable, gas permeable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane and deployed in a freshwater environment. This allows measurements of CO2 concentration to be made directly at a specific depth in the water column without the need for pumps or reagents. We demonstrate the potential of the method using examples from different aquatic environments characterized by a range of CO2 concentrations (0.5–8.0 mg CO2-C L-1, equivalent to ca 40–650 $\mu$mol CO2 L-1). These comprise streams and ponds from tropical, temperate and boreal regions. Data derived from the sensor was compared with direct measurements of CO2 concentrations using headspace analysis. Sensor performance following long-term ({\textgreater}6 months) field deployment conformed to manufacturers' specifications, with no drift detected. We conclude that the sensor-based method is a robust, accurate and responsive method, with a wide range of potential applications, particularly when combined with other in situ sensor-based measurements of related variables.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in streams is important, yet few studies focus on DOC dynamics in Midwestern streams during storms. In this study, stream DOC dynamics during storms in two Midwestern watersheds with contrasting land uses, the change in character of stream DOC during storms, and the usability of DOC as a hydrologic tracer in artificially drained landscapes of the Midwest are investigated. Major cation/DOC concentrations, and DOC specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and fluorescence index (FI) were monitored at 2-4 h intervals during three spring storms. Although DOC is less aromatic in the mixed land use watershed than in the agricultural watershed, land use has little impact on stream DOC concentration during storms. For both watersheds, DOC concentration follows discharge, and SUVA and FI values indicate an increase in stream DOC aromaticity and lignin content during storms. The comparison of DOC/major cation flushing dynamics indicates that DOC is mainly exported via overland flow/macropore flow. In both watersheds, the increase in DOC concentration in the streams during storms corresponds to a shift in the source of DOC from DOC originating from mineral soil layers of the soil profile at baseflow, to DOC originating from surficial soil layers richer in aromatic substances and lignin during storms. Results also suggest that DOC, SUVA and FI could be used as hydrologic tracers in artificially drained landscapes of the Midwest. These results underscore the importance of sampling streams for DOC during high flow periods in order to understand the fate of DOC in streams. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The quantity and character of dissolved organic matter (DOM) can change rapidly during storm events, affecting key biogeochemical processes, carbon bioavailability, metal pollutant transport, and disinfection byproduct formation during drinking water treatment. We used in situ ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometers to concurrently measure dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and spectral slope ratio, a proxy for DOM molecular weight. Measurements were made at 15-minute intervals over three years in three streams draining primarily agricultural, urban, and forested watersheds. We describe storm event dynamics by calculating hysteresis indices for DOC concentration and spectral slope ratio for 220 storms and present a novel analytical framework that can be used to interpret these metrics together. DOC concentration and spectral slope ratio differed significantly among sites, and individual storm DOM dynamics were remarkably variable at each site and among the three sites. Distinct patterns emerged for storm DOM dynamics depending on land use/land cover (LULC) of each watershed. In agricultural and forested streams, DOC concentration increased after the time of peak discharge, and spectral slope ratio dynamics indicate that this delayed flux was of relatively higher molecular weight material compared to the beginning of each storm. In contrast, DOM character during storms at the urban stream generally shifted to lower molecular weight while DOC concentration increased on the falling limb, indicating either the introduction of lower molecular weight DOM, the exhaustion of a higher molecular weight DOM sources, or a combination of these factors. We show that the combination of high-frequency DOM character and quantity metrics have the potential to provide new insight into short-timescale DOM dynamics and can reveal previously unknown effects of LULC on the chemical nature, source, and timing of DOM export during storms.},

abstract = {From headwaters to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a con-tinuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream conununities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjust-ments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a frame-work for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implica-tions of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The perhumid region of the coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) of Pacific North America is one of the wettest places on Earth and contains numerous small catchments that discharge freshwater and high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) directly to the coastal ocean. However, empirical data on the flux and composition of DOC exported from these watersheds are scarce. We established monitoring stations at the outlets of seven catchments on Calvert and Hecate islands, British Columbia, which represent the rain-dominated hypermaritime region of the perhumid CTR. Over several years, we measured stream discharge, stream water DOC concentration, and stream water dissolved organic-matter (DOM) composition. Discharge and DOC concentrations were used to calculate DOC fluxes and yields, and DOM composition was characterized using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The areal estimate of annual DOC yield in water year 2015 was 33.3 Mg C km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, with individual watersheds ranging from an average of 24.1 to 37.7 Mg C km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. This represents some of the highest DOC yields to be measured at the coastal margin. We observed seasonality in the quantity and composition of exports, with the majority of DOC export occurring during the extended wet period (September–April). Stream flow from catchments reacted quickly to rain inputs, resulting in rapid export of relatively fresh, highly terrestrial-like DOM. DOC concentration and measures of DOM composition were related to stream discharge and stream temperature and correlated with watershed attributes, including the extent of lakes and wetlands, and the thickness of organic and mineral soil horizons. Our discovery of high DOC yields from these small catchments in the CTR is especially compelling as they deliver relatively fresh, highly terrestrial organic matter directly to the coastal ocean. Hypermaritime landscapes are common on the British Columbia coast, suggesting that this coastal margin may play an important role in the regional processing of carbon and in linking terrestrial carbon to marine ecosystems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This paper presents a process for estimating pollutant loads from water quality data, to improve catchment-scale modelling in the region for resource management purposes. It describes a program to estimate suspended sediment, total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus loads to the Tuross estuary from the Tuross River catchment (1810 km2) of coastal southeast Australia. Event-based water quality sampling results obtained during storm events in 2005 are presented. Event 1, during July 2005 was the largest storm event in terms of peak flow for 3.5 years. Other events monitored were also in July, November and December 2005. The early July 2005 event had a flow-weighted mean suspended sediment (SS) concentration during the first 4 days of 63 mg L-1. Of the events monitored, this was unusual as it was preceded by drought and had the largest SS concentrations (peaking at 180 mg L-1) during the rising-stage. In contrast, the November event had a much lower flow-weighted SS mean (28 mg L-1), even though peak flow magnitudes were similar. The July and November 2005 events had peak flows of 12,360 and 11,330 ML day-1. Low-cost rising-stage siphon samplers were used to collect samples during the rapidly rising phase of these events. The use of such samplers and consideration of time-lead/lag flow adjustments, quantified using cross-correlation analysis to account for hysteresis effects, were incorporated into the load estimation techniques. The technique is a potentially useful approach for understanding relationships between water quality concentrations and flow for modelling catchment source strengths and transport processes.

abstract = {This work investigated the application of several fluorescence excitation-emission matrix analysis methods as natural organic matter (NOM) indicators for use in predicting the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Waters from four different sources (two rivers and two lakes) were subjected to jar testing followed by 24hr disinfection by-product formation tests using chlorine. NOM was quantified using three common measures: dissolved organic carbon, ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm, and specific ultraviolet absorbance as well as by principal component analysis, peak picking, and parallel factor analysis of fluorescence spectra. Based on multi-linear modeling of THMs and HAAs, principle component (PC) scores resulted in the lowest mean squared prediction error of cross-folded test sets (THMs: 43.7 (??g/L)2, HAAs: 233.3 (??g/L)2). Inclusion of principle components representative of protein-like material significantly decreased prediction error for both THMs and HAAs. Parallel factor analysis did not identify a protein-like component and resulted in prediction errors similar to traditional NOM surrogates as well as fluorescence peak picking. These results support the value of fluorescence excitation-emission matrix-principal component analysis as a suitable NOM indicator in predicting the formation of THMs and HAAs for the water sources studied.},

abstract = {Natural organic matter (NOM) is the major precursor to the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water treatment. Specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) is a widely used surrogate parameter to characterize NOM and predict its DBP formation potential. The objective of this study was to determine the relationships between SUVA and different classes of DBPs formed by NOM fractions from different sources. Three natural waters with a wide SUVA range were fractionated into differing hydrophobicity and molecular weight groups using XAD-4 and XAD-8 resins and ultrafiltration membranes. Each NOM fraction was treated with chlorine and monochloramine under controlled laboratory conditions. Different classes of DBPs showed different relationships with SUVA. SUVA correlated strongly with trihaloacetic acids (THAAs) and unknown total organic halogen (UTOX) yields whereas weak correlations were observed between SUVA and trihalomethane (THM) and dihaloacetic acid (DHAA) yields during chlorination. These results reinforce the hypothesis that DHAAs and THAAs form through different precursors and reaction pathways. Strong correlation between SUVA and UTOX was also observed during chloramination. However, no significant relationship was observed between SUVA and chloramination THMs and DHAAs. Overall, SUVA is a good indicator for the formation of unknown DBPs. This indicates that UV absorbing compounds and aromatic carbon within NOM are the primary sources of precursors for unknown DBPs.},

abstract = {Most states in the U.S. are currently developing methods for assessing the integrity of aquatic habitats through the development of regional biocriteria. While multimetric indices have been used to show community composition, pollution tolerance, species diversity, and trophic structure with a combined index, the specific environmental factors that drive biological communities may be better explained through the use of multivariate statistical techniques. Macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages were sampled along with water quality, landuse and qualitative and quantitative habitat assessments from forty-nine sites throughout the Choctawhatchee-Pea, a southeastern U.S. watershed. Multivariate statistical analyses of habitat, water quality, and land-use data were used to determine the relationship between environmental variables and the dependent biological variables, macroinvertebrate and fish community structure. Sampling of biological and environmental data showed that there was a great deal of homogeneity within the watershed, which complicated the task of identifying environmental influences on biological assemblages. Macro-invertebrate and fish assemblages of the Choctawhatchee-Pea watershed were similar in their response to environmental conditions with water chemistry having the greatest relationship to macro-invertebrate and fish community structure followed by instream habitat and land use.

The relative importance of seasonal-scale predictors allowed for the separation of three hydroclimatic states (warm and dry, cold and wet, and intermediate). The specific DOC quality for each state indicates a shift in the activated source zones and highlights the importance of antecedent conditions and their impact on DOC accumulation and mobilization in the riparian zone. The warm and dry state results in high DOC concentrations during events and low concentrations between events and thus can be seen as mobilization limited, whereas the cold and wet state results in low concentration between and during events due to limited DOC accumulation in the riparian zone. The study demonstrates the considerable value of continuous high-frequency measurements of DOC quality and quantity and its (hydroclimatic) key controlling variables in quantitatively unraveling DOC mobilization in the riparian zone. These variables can be linked to DOC source activation by discharge events and the more seasonal control of DOC production in riparian soils.},

abstract = {Variation in water chemistry was studied in 80 lakes in southern Sweden. The lakes had forest dominated catchments. The length of the time series was 14 years. Synchrony was calculated as Pearson's product moment correlation coefficients for all combinations of lakes, i.e. 3160 lake-pairs. The chemical variables studied were non-marine sulphate (SO4*), non-marine calcium (Ca*), absorbance and acid neutralising capacity (ANC). Statistically significant synchrony occurred in 93{\%} of all lake-pairs for SO4*, and between 58 and 67{\%} for absorbance, Ca* and ANC. In 70{\%} of all lake-pairs, the synchrony was {\textgreater} 0.71 for SO4*, which means that more than half of the variation in one lake could be explained by the variation in the other lake. For absorbance, Ca* and ANC, about 25{\%} of the lake-pairs had a synchrony {\textgreater} 0.71. The relatively high synchrony for SO4* occurred during an overall downward trend in SO4* concentration. The degree of synchrony in our study was at a level co mparable to other studies in northern America and England. However, our study included lakes in a much larger area, with distances of up to 500 km between the lakes, while earlier studies were made on small lake districts with lakes located within approximately 50 km. In contrast to these earlier studies, there was no correlation between synchrony and distance, lake characteristics or catchment characteristics. However, when a small subset of 15 lakes in the southeast of Sweden was selected, such relations were found. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

abstract = {We compared stream ecosystem responses to two types of disturbances: flood and debris flows. A large storm in February 1996 disturbed four similarly sized sub-watersheds of the Calapooia River, in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA. All sub-watersheds had flood and in two, 31 and 81{\%} of the perennial channel, a debris flow affected the channel. For 8 years, we used a suite of approaches: stream temperature, nutrient regime, periphyton and macroinvertebrate assemblages, and resident trout abundance and habitat to evaluate the persistence of instream impacts. Differences in stream temperatures and nitrate- nitrogen concentrations were evident, probably, due to the removal of vegetation and modification of riparian soils at the debris flow sites. Instream biological responses varied. After the event, fish, including trout, were rare with no fish at the debris flow sites. Within 6 years, trout densities (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Oncorhynchus clarki) were similar and young-of-the-year trouts were common. In contrast, periphyton and macroinvertebrate assemblages differed. Periphyton biomass was lower and nitrogen-fixing periphyton was more abundant at the debris flow sites. Macroinvertebrate assemblage diversity was higher at the debris flow sites due to fewer dominant taxa. Macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups also differed with fewer gatherers and more scrapers at the debris flow sites. Debris flow impacts related to loss of riparian canopy will probably persist until mature red alder stands are re-established along stream-reaches affected by debris flows to provide nitrogen input and shade.},

Here, we modify the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model to include a physically-based representation of the effects of freezing and thawing soil on the runoff generation process. This model is called the SAC-SMA Heat Transfer model (SAC-HT). The frozen ground physics are taken from the Noah land surface model which serves as the land surface component of several National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) numerical weather prediction models. SAC-HT requires a boundary condition of the soil temperature at the bottom of the soil column (a climatic annual air temperature is typically used, and parameters derived from readily available soil texture data). A noteworthy feature of SAC-HT is that the frozen ground component needs no parameter calibration. SAC-HT was tested at 11 sites in the U.S. for soil temperature, one site in Russia for soil temperature and soil moisture, eight basins in the upper Midwest for the effects of frozen-ground on streamflow, and one location for frost depth. High correlation coefficients for simulated soil temperature at three depths at 11 stations were achieved. Multi-year simulations of soil moisture and soil temperature agreed very well at the Valdai, Russia test location. In eight basins affected by seasonally frozen soil in the upper Midwest, SAC-HT provided improved streamflow simulations compared to SAC-SMA when both models used a priori parameters. Further improvement was gained through calibration of the non-frozen ground a priori parameters. Frost depth computed by SAC-HT compared well with observed values in the Root River basin in Minnesota.},

The purpose of this study is to identify the hydrologic processes in different landscape zones, based on the isotopic and hydrochemical analysis of glacier, snow, frozen soil and groundwater. The chemical compositions were characterized by Ca–HCO3 in the glacier snow zone, Mg–Ca–SO4–HCO3 in the alpine cold desert zone, Ca–Mg–HCO3 in the marsh meadow zone, Ca–Mg–HCO3 in the alpine shrub zone, and Na–Ca–SO4 in the mountain grassland zone. The end-member mixing model was employed for hydrograph separation. The results showed that during the melting period Mafengou River water was recharged by glacier–snow melt water about 34{\%}, thawed frozen soil water in each of the landscape zones about 12{\%}, and groundwater about 54{\%}. This study suggested that Mafengou River water during the melting period was mainly recharged by glacier–snow melt water, groundwater and thawed frozen soil water.},

Here I suggest several promising directions forward, including (1) designing new data networks, field observations, and field experiments, with explicit recognition of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of hydrologic processes, (2) replacing linear, additive "black box" models with "gray box" approaches that better capture the nonlinear and non-additive character of hydrologic systems, (3) developing physically based governing equations for hydrologic behavior at the catchment or hills lope scale, recognizing that they may look different from the equations that describe the small-scale physics, (4) developing models that are minimally parameterized and therefore stand some chance of failing the tests that they are subjected to, and (5) developing ways to test models more comprehensively and incisively. I argue that scientific progress will mostly be achieved through the collision of theory and data, rather than through increasingly elaborate and parameter-rich models that may succeed as mathematical marionettes, dancing to match the calibration data even if their underlying premises are unrealistic. Thus advancing the science of hydrology will require not only developing theories that get the right answers but also testing whether they get the right answers for the right reasons.

abstract = {Understanding the factors that affect freshwater export of terrestrially derived carbon is key to creating a comprehensive model of stream ecology and to developing an accurate carbon budget. Though efforts have been made to quantify carbon in Pacific Northwest forests, little is known about the carbon in their freshwater systems. To begin informing this knowledge gap, we collected dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and water quality data along the stream networks of four small, fish-bearing watersheds in the Olympic Experimental State Forest on the Olympic Peninsula, WA during the summer and fall of 2018. Conditional reference random forest models were used to explore how landscape characteristics and climatic variables affect the spatial and temporal variability of carbon composition and water quality parameters. We found that slope-related variables and precipitation were the primary drivers of carbon export. The strengths and magnitudes of these relationships were different for the summer and fall. We also identified two pools of different carbon composition that were present in three of the four study watersheds. The results of this study give us a first look at the drivers of carbon export and the quantity and quality of carbon being exported through freshwater systems. Our work also advises on the spatial and temporal considerations of stream carbon monitoring. We identify three key questions to pursue in future studies that will improve our understanding of stream carbon on the Olympic Peninsula and allow us to monitor it going forward. Our results indicate that future research should explore seasonal variability, hyporheic influences, and management impacts on carbon dynamics},

abstract = {1.Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a central role in the dynamics of stream and river ecosystems, affecting processes such as metabolism, the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy, acidity, nutrient uptake and bioavailability of toxic compounds. However, despite its importance to stream processes, restoration and management activities rarely incorporate DOC as a major management criterion. 2.Lotic DOC pools reflect terrestrial organic carbon accumulation, transfer to the river channel and aquatic processing. In pristine landscapes, characteristics such as topography, climate, and landscape composition are strong predictors of terrestrial accumulation and transfer. Within aquatic systems, the quantity and form of DOC are altered by a variety of processes including primary production, microbial breakdown, sorption to particles and photodegradation. 3.Terrestrial accumulation, transfer and aquatic processing of DOC in agricultural and other human-dominated landscapes are all subject to substantial change. Consequently, DOC pools in agricultural streams likely differ from historic conditions and now include more labile material and low concentrations of a variety of ubiquitous synthetic organic compounds (e.g. pesticides, antibiotics). 4.Although DOC change in agricultural streams and associated ecological consequences are expected to be widespread, current understanding and relevant data needed to manage affected systems are surprisingly scarce. 5.Wetland and riparian restoration projects have variable effects on fluvial DOC regimes, but management at this intermediate scale is a realistic compromise between the small extent of most restoration projects and the large spatial scale over which organic carbon impairment occurs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {It is important to understand how dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is processed and transported through stream networks because DOC is a master water quality variable in aquatic ecosystems. High-frequency sampling is necessary to capture important, rapid shifts in DOC source, concentration, and composition (i.e. quality) in streams. Until recently, this high-frequency sampling was logistically difficult or impossible. However, this type of sampling can now be conducted using in-situ optical measurements through long-term, field-deployable fluorometers and spectrophotometers. The optical data collected from these instruments can quantify both DOC concentration and composition properties (e.g., specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio, and fluorescence index). Previously, the use of these sensors was limited to a small number of specialized users, mainly in Europe and North America, where they were used predominantly in marine DOC studies as well as water treatment and management infrastructure. However, recent field demonstrations across a wide range of river systems reveals a large potential for the use of these instruments in freshwater environments, heightening interest and demand across multiple environmental research and management disciplines. Hence, this review provides an up-to-date synthesis on 1) the use of spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool in stream DOC studies, 2) the instrumentation, its applications, potential limitations and future considerations, and 3) the new watershed DOC research directions made possible via these in-situ optical sensors.},

abstract = {Dynamics of river dissolved organic matter (DOM) during storm events have profound influences on the downstream aquatic ecosystem and drinking water safety. This study investigated temporal variations in DOM during four storm events in two forest headwater streams (the EH and JH brooks, South Korea) and the impacts on the disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formation potential. The within-event variations of most DOM quantity parameters were similar to the flow rate in the EH but not in the larger JH brook. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed clockwise and counterclockwise hysteresis with the flow rate in the EH and JH brooks, respectively, indicating the importance of both flow path and DOM source pool size in determining the effects of storm events. The stream DOM became less aromatic/humified from the first to the last event in both brooks, probably due to the increasing fresh plant pool and the decreasing leaf litter pool during the course of rainy season. The DOC export during each event increased 1.3-2.7- and 1.1-7.0-fold by stormflows in the EH and JH brooks, respectively. The leaf litter and soil together was the major DOM source, particularly during early events. The enhanced DOM export probably increases the risks of DBPs formation in disinfection, as indicated by a strong correlation observed between DOC and trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP). High correlations between two humic-like fluorescent components and THMFP further suggested the potential of assessing THMFP with in situ fluorescence sensors during storms.},

abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is being increasingly used to help drinking water utilities meet finished water quality regulations, but its influence on disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors and DBP formation is not completely understood. This study investigated the effect of medium pressure (MP) UV combined with chlorination/chloramination on the fluorescent fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from a United States surface water with median total organic carbon content. Parallel factor analysis was used to understand how UV may alter the capacity of DOM to form DBPs of potential human health concern. The production of chloral hydrate and cyanogen chloride from MP UV followed by chlorine or chloramine, respectively, correlated with a decrease in fluorescence intensity of a protein/tryptophan-like component (R2=0.79-0.99) and a humic-like component (R2=0.91-1.00). This suggests that the UV-induced precursors to these compounds originated from DOM with similar characteristics to these components. The fluorescent DOM components identified in this study are similar to reoccurring components that have been previously identified in a range of raw and treated waters, and this work demonstrates the value of using fluorescence analysis of DOM to understand the relationships between DOM source and DBP formation under a range of treatment conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Monitoring the isotopic composition ($\delta$13CDOC) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during flood events can be helpful for locating DOC sources in catchments and quantifying their relative contribution to stream DOC flux. High-resolution ({\textless} hourly basis) $\delta$ 13CDOC data were obtained during six successive storm events occurring during the high-flow period in a small headwater catchment in western France. Intra-storm $\delta$13CDOC values exhibit a marked temporal variability, with some storms showing large variations ({\textgreater} 2 ‰), and others yielding a very restricted range of values ({\textless} 1 ‰). Comparison of these results with previously published data shows that the range of intra-storm $\delta$13CDOC values closely reflects the temporal and spatial variation in $\delta$13CDOC observed in the riparian soils of this catchment during the same period. Using $\delta$13CDOC data in conjunction with hydrometric monitoring and an end-member mixing approach (EMMA), we show that (i) {\textgreater} 80{\%} of the stream DOC flux flows through the most superficial soil horizons of the riparian domain and (ii) the riparian soil DOC flux is comprised of DOC coming ultimately from both riparian and upland domains. Based on its $\delta$13C fingerprint, we find that the upland DOC contribution decreases from ca.∼30{\%} of the stream DOC flux at the beginning of the high-flow period to {\textless} 10{\%} later in this period. Overall, upland domains contribute significantly to stream DOC export, but act as a size-limited reservoir, whereas soils in the wetland domains act as a near-infinite reservoir. Through this study, we show that $\delta$13CDOC provides a powerful tool for tracing DOC sources and DOC transport mechanisms in headwater catchments, having a high-resolution assessment of temporal and spatial variability. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

During a fluoroscopic examination, the operator controls activation of the x-ray tube for real-time imaging of the patient. The article provides a general overview of fluoroscopic imaging from its initial development to modern use. Early fluoroscopes produced a dim image on a fluorescent screen that required dark adaptation of the physician's eyes to optimize viewing conditions. Image intensifiers were later developed to replace the fluorescent screen and increase image brightness. Modern fluoroscopy systems include an image intensifier with television image display and a choice of several different types of image recording devices. Fluoroscopic equipment is available in many different configurations for use in a wide variety of clinical applications.},

abstract = {The present study demonstrates that the spectral slope coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) between 275 nm and 295 nm (S275–295) can be used as a tracer of the percent terrigenous dissolved organic carbon ({\%}tDOC) in river-influenced ocean margins, where rivers exert an important control on carbon dynamics and CO2 fluxes. Absorption coefficients of CDOM and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved lignin were measured on a seasonal basis in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers and in surface waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGoM). A strong, linear relationship between lignin concentrations and CDOM absorption coefficients indicated lignin is an important chromophore in this environment. The dual nature of lignin as an important chromophore in CDOM and as a terrigenous component of DOC facilitated development of the tracer. The applicability of the tracer relies on the existence of a strong, nonlinear relationship between S275–295 and the DOC-normalized lignin yield in rivers and along the freshwater–marine continuum in the NGoM. Physical mixing and the effects of photodegradation on S275–295 and dissolved lignin were largely responsible for maintaining this relationship, suggesting the tracer is applicable to surface waters of most river-influenced ocean margins. The spectral slope coefficient (S275–295) provides new capabilities to trace tDOC on synoptic scales of relevance to ocean margins and represents an important tool for improving ocean carbon budgets.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical component of the carbon cycle linking terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Although many factors have been identified as influencing DOM fluxes and biochemical quality in rivers with varying land cover types, controls on DOM composition in forested headwater catchments of the western U.S. are poorly understood. This study examined the effect of hydrologic patterns and forest management history on stream DOM chemistry at watersheds located in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest of the Oregon Cascades. Specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254), generally indicative of aromaticity, increased in streams during storms with increasing surficial soil horizon and litter DOM inputs. Fluorescence excitation and emission matrices (EEMs) with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) identified a protein-like DOM fluorescent component as well as several other components associated with terrestrial plant material. Correlation analysis between the protein-like DOM component and hydrologic patterns, SUVA254, and DOC concentrations suggest that DOM during dry seasons represents more microbially-processed sources, such as protein-rich, deeper soil or DOM with greater in-stream microbial processing, compared to more plant-like surface soil sources observed during high flow. The base flow index (the proportion of base flow to total flow) showed a high correlation with the relative proportion of protein-like DOM indicating that deep soil water is a source of the protein-like signal. The relative proportions of the protein-like DOM and humic DOM were also influenced by the abundance of coarse woody debris (CWD), but not live tree biomass, with the proportions of protein-like DOM highest in harvested watersheds with low surficial CWD. This study shows UV and fluorescent spectroscopy is a viable finger printing method to elucidate DOM sources in pristine headwater streams at the western Cascades of Oregon.},

abstract = {The response of a stream ecosystem to disturbance in its watershed was investigated by comparing mass balances of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for a stream draining an undisturbed watershed with a stream draining a watershed that was clear-cut 2 yr before the study began. These second-order streams are in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina. Both streams had similar, elevated DOC concentrations (from {\textless}1 to 5 mg/L) during storms. Rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph also had similar DOC concentrations. During the growing season DOC concentration increased from headwater seep to the weir in the undisturbed stream under baseflow conditions. No significant longitudinal change was observed in the stream draining the clear-cut watershed. Hence concentration was consistently lower in baseflow samples during the growing season in the stream draining the clear-cut watershed. As a result annual DOC export from the clear-cut watershed was less (9.8-11.5 kg/ha) than from the reference watershed (14.6-15.1 kg/ha). The lower DOC export was partly due to reduced DOC inputs from throughfall and leaching of fresh litter, but most impor- tantly to lower DOC inputs in subsurface water and probably also less in-stream generation of DOC. The rate of recovery of this stream from disturbance is therefore dependent on the rate at which the terrestrial system recovers},

A critical question for understanding contemporary and future responses to environmental change is how the spatio-temporal dynamics of runoff generation processes will be affected. We sampled stable water isotopes in soils, lakes and rivers on an unprecedented spatio-temporal scale along a 1700 km transect over three years in the Western Siberia Lowlands. Our findings suggest that snowmelt mixes with, and displaces, large volumes of water stored in the organic soils and lakes to generate runoff during the thaw season. Furthermore, we saw a persistent hydrological connection between water bodies and the landscape across permafrost regions. Our findings help to bridge the understanding between small and large scale hydrological studies in high-latitude systems. These isotope data provide a means to conceptualise hydrological connectivity in permafrost and wetland influenced regions, which is needed for an improved understanding of future biogeochemical changes.},

abstract = {Streams draining upland catchments carry large quantities of carbon from terrestrial stocks to downstream freshwater and marine ecosystems. Here it either enters long-term storage in sediments or enters the atmosphere as gaseous carbon through a combination of biotic and abiotic processes. There are, however, increasing concerns over the long-term stability of terrestrial carbon stores in blanket peatland catchments as a result of anthropogenic pressures and climate change. We analysed sub-annual and inter-annual changes in river water colour (a reliable proxy measurement of dissolved organic carbon; DOC) using 6 years of weekly data, from 2011 to 2016. This time-series dataset was gathered from three contiguous river sub-catchments, the Black, the Glenamong and the Srahrevagh, in a blanket peatland catchment system in western Ireland, and it was used to identify the drivers that best explained observed temporal change in river colour. The data were also used to estimate annual DOC loads from each catchment. General additive mixed modelling was used to identify the principle environmental drivers of water colour in the rivers, while wavelet cross-correlation analysis was used to identify common frequencies in correlations. At 130mgPtCoL-1, the mean colour levels in the Srahrevagh (the sub-catchment with lowest rainfall and higher forest cover) were almost 50{\%} higher than those from the Black and Glenamong, at 95 and 84mgPtCoL-1 respectively. The decomposition of the colour datasets revealed similar multi-annual, annual and event-based (random component) trends, illustrating that environmental drivers operated synchronously at each of these temporal scales. For both the Black and its nested Srahrevagh catchment, three variables (soil temperature, soil moisture deficit, SMD, and the weekly North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO) combined to explain 54{\%} and 58{\%} of the deviance in colour respectively. In the Glenamong, which had steeper topography and a higher percentage of peat intersected by streams, soil temperature, the log of stream discharge and the NAO explained 66{\%} of the colour concentrations. Cross-wavelet time-series analysis between river colour and each environmental driver revealed a significant high common power relationship at an annual time step. Each relationship however, varied in phase, further highlighting the complexity of the mechanisms driving river colour in the sub-catchments. The estimated mean annual DOC loads for the Black and Glenamong rivers to Lough Feeagh were similar at 15.0 and 14.7tCkm-21 respectively. The important role of past and current precipitation and, in particular, temperature emphasises the vulnerability of blanket peatland carbon stores to projected climate change and highlights the interaction of local and regional climate in controlling aquatic carbon export. Our results show that water colour (and hence DOC) concentrations can vary considerably between neighbouring catchments and also that regional-scale climatic drivers control the trends in intra-and inter-annual flux of DOC through the system. The combination of locally determined concentrations and regionally controlled fluxes produces aquatic DOC loads that vary over both the annual cycle and over multiple years.},

It is demonstrated that a two-component model cannot reproduce all the hysteresis forms commonly observed. A method, based on the three-component system, is derived by which C/Q hysteresis can be used to predict relative component concentrations. This may provide a qualitative chemical description of sources supplying runoff for locations where these have not yet been directly established or a validation test where possible components have been sampled. The method has been tested using data collected at streams in the Adirondacks, New York, and the Northern Appalachian Plateau, Pennsylvania, during the Episodic Response Project of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Predicted component compositions were in good agreement with measurements made during other studies and with those subsequently obtained from one of the Pennsylvania watersheds.},

abstract = {Encouraging adaptation is an essential aspect of the policy response to climate change. Adaptation seeks to reduce the harmful consequences and harness any beneficial opportunities arising from the changing climate. However, given that human activities are the main cause of environmental transformations worldwide, it follows that adaptation itself also has the potential to generate further pressures, creating new threats for both local and global ecosystems. From this perspective, policies designed to encourage adaptation may conflict with regulation aimed at preserving or enhancing environmental quality. This aspect of adaptation has received relatively little consideration in either policy design or academic debate. To highlight this issue, we analyse the trade-offs between two fundamental ecosystem services that will be impacted by climate change: provisioning services derived from agriculture and regulating services in the form of freshwater quality. Results indicate that climate adaptation in the farming sector will generate fundamental changes in river water quality. In some areas, policies that encourage adaptation are expected to be in conflict with existing regulations aimed at improving freshwater ecosystems. These findings illustrate the importance of anticipating the wider impacts of human adaptation to climate change when designing environmental policies.},

abstract = {Despite an increasing recognition of the importance of extreme rainfall events for organic carbon export to inland waters, little attention has been paid to the export and reactivity of particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) in mountainous headwater watersheds under monsoon climates. To investigate environmental implications of storm-enhanced export of POC and DOC in mountainous headwater streams, we examined the relationships between storm magnitude and C export from a forested watershed in the Haean Basin, South Korea, during 13 storm events over 4 years and compared potentials of DOC and POC for biodegradation and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation during an extreme rainfall event with a total rainfall of 209 mm. Event mean concentrations and export of POC increased nonlinearly above thresholds of precipitation and discharge, far exceeding the relatively small increases of DOC. The export of POC during a few storm events with a total rainfall above 200 mm per event exceeded the annual organic C export during dry years. During the 209 mm storm event, concentrations of total trihalomethanes formed by POC-derived dissolved components changed synchronously with POC concentrations, exhibiting lower levels than those formed by DOC. During a 30-day incubation at 25 degrees C, DOC exported during peak flow exhibited rapid biodegradation of labile components within 7 days. In contrast, the concentrations of DOC leached from POC gradually increased following the initial decline. Gradual transformation of POC-derived dissolved materials resulted in greater increases in the intensity of fulvic-and humic-like fluorescent components compared to the DOC treatment. The results highlight the significance of extreme rainfall events as "hot moments" for POC export from mountainous watersheds and also suggest that storm pulses of POC can provide potential sources of reactive organic components that can rapidly biodegrade and form DBPs after being released into headwater streams.},

abstract = {Background: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. Results: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. Conclusion: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {We investigated the spatial and temporal connectivity between concentrations of organic carbon in stream water and the soil carbon pool in a small (1.3 km2) upland catchment in NE Scotland by comparing downstream changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with spatial changes in the soil carbon pool. Stream water DOC concentrations increased downstream to reach a maximum in the center of the catchment and then decreased in the lower part of the catchment, a pattern that was linked to spatial changes in the soil carbon pool. Subcatchment analysis of the soil carbon pool and DOC export showed that the strong relationship between percent of peat coverage and stream water DOC in the upper part of the catchment did not hold farther downstream, where freely draining mineral soils become spatially more important. Temporal variations in stream water and soil water DOC concentrations in the central part of the catchment were studied using samples collected from two depths (0.20-0.45 m and 0.65-0.95 m) in the two most important soil types there (histosols and fluvisols). Stream water DOC concentrations were only related to soil water DOC in shallow peat. DOC concentration in shallow peat and stream water were both positively correlated with temperature. Multivariate regression analysis showed that 55{\%} of the variation in stream water DOC concentrations could be explained by a model including stream temperature, discharge, and soil solution DOC concentrations in the shallow histosols. We conclude that the linkage between stream water DOC concentrations and the soil C pool in the upper 1.5 km of the stream reach are likely to be driven by temperature-related DOC production in near-surface histosols. Farther downstream, this relationship between organic carbon in the soil and stream becomes weaker as other processes (e.g., lower inputs from minerals soils and allochthonous within-stream processing of DOC) become more important.

Results showed that the surface soil intercepted 94.4 ± 1.2 {\%} of the annual litter leachate DOC flux and is a sink for DOC. The throughfall and litter leachate DOC fluxes amounted to 6.81 and 7.23 {\%} of the net ecosystem exchange respectively, indicating that the DOC flux through hydrological processes is an important component of the carbon budget, and may be an important link between hydrological processes and soil respiration in a tropical rainforest. Even the variability in soil respiration is more dependent on the hydrologically transported water than DOC flux insignificantly, soil temperature, and soil-water content (at 0–20 cm). The difference in $\delta$13C between the soil, soil water (at 0–20 cm), throughfall, and litter leachate indicated that DOC is transformed in the surface soil and decreased the sensitivity indices of soil respiration of DOC flux to water flux, which suggests that soil respiration is more sensitive to the DOC flux in hydrological processes, especially the soil-water DOC flux, than to soil temperature or soil moisture.},

abstract = {Storm events in montane catchments are the main cause of mobilization of solutes and particulates into and within stream channels in coastal California. Nonlinear behavior of nutrients and suspended sediments during storms is evident in the hysteresis that arises in concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships. We examined patterns in the C-Q hysteresis of nutrients (NO-3, NH+4, DON, and PO3-4) and total suspended solids (TSS) during storms across 10 sites and water years 2002–2015 by quantifying the slope of the C-Q relationship and the rotational pattern of the hysteresis loop. We observed several hysteresis types in the ∼400 storms included in our study. Concentrations of constituents associated with sediment transport (PO3-4 and TSS) peaked during high flows. Conversely, nitrogen species had hysteretic responses such as dilution with clockwise rotation in urban sites and enrichment with anticlockwise rotation in undeveloped sites. The wide range of C-Q responses that occurred among sites and seasons reflected the variable hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics of catchments and storms. Responses for nitrate in nested catchments differed in slope and rotation of C-Q hysteresis. Upland undeveloped and lowland urban sites had anticlockwise rotation at the onset of the rainy season following a dry year, which implied a delay in the transport of this solute to the streams. Slopes by the middle of the rainy season showed that the urban site switched from dilution to enrichment, and then again to dilution with clockwise rotation at the end of the season, which implied high initial concentrations and proximal sources.},

@article{Bond-Lamberty2010,
abstract = {Soil respiration, R(S), the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide (CO(2)) from the soil surface to the atmosphere, is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux. However, the dynamics of R(S) are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained. Ecosystem warming experiments, modelling analyses and fundamental biokinetics all suggest that R(S) should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R(S), inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure R(S) on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global R(S) values in the extant four-decade record of R(S) chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide R(S) observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R(S) record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO(2) measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961-1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in R(S). We estimate that the global R(S) in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 +/- 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) between 1989 and 2008, implying a global R(S) response to air temperature (Q(10)) of 1.5. An increasing global R(S) value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.},

@article{Biron1999,
abstract = {The relationship between stream discharge and the concentration of different solutes reflects the hydrological processes occurring in a catchment, but is also strongly affected by antecedent moisture conditions. In this study, the effects of antecedent conditions were examined for a small forested watershed near Montreal (Quebec) by comparing data from sequences of fall events for two years of contrasting antecedent moisture conditions. The relationship between discharge and stream water chemistry was also quantified using cross-correlation analysis. Results show that concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, nitrate and calcium increased during storm events with dry antecedent conditions but that the relationships were weaker under wet conditions. For both years, concentrations of sulfate, silicon and sodium and the pH were negatively correlated with discharge (cross-correlations from -0{\textperiodcentered}20 to -0{\textperiodcentered}53). With dry antecedent conditions, there was a general decrease in the concentration of all solutes with time, whereas concentrations remained at about the same level under wet conditions. The concentration-discharge relationships for sulfate shifted frequently from higher concentrations during the rising limb to higher concentrations during the falling limb from one event to another as a result of changing antecedent conditions. Although the contrast in antecedent moisture conditions between the two years was moderate in comparison with that reported in other studies (25{\%} dryer than average in 1995 and 12{\%} wetter than average in 1996), the hydrochemistry of the stream was markedly different.},

abstract = {Predicting sediment production from forest roads is necessary to determine their impact on watersheds and associated terrestrial and stream biota. A method is presented for measuring sediment originating from a road segment for individual storm events and quantifying the delivery to streams. Site selection criteria are listed to describe the characteristics for efficient data collection and analysis. The method describes equipment used to quantify sediment transport—data loggers, a rain gage, a traffic counter, Parshall flumes with stilling wells, hydrostatic pressure transducers, and water pumping samplers—as well as variables associated with sediment production—road surfacing material, traffic intensity, gradient, age, construction method, and precipitation. A sampling protocol that worked well for the forest roads in southeast Alaska and can be adapted for use in other regions also is described. Examples of data collection and analysis are explained both for sites near the road and downstream sites for sediment delivery quantification. This method can be used to determine the downstream transport of sediment originating from roads and developing regression models or validating existing sediment models.},

@article{Kellerman2018,
abstract = {The link between composition and reactivity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is central to understanding the role aquatic systems play in the global carbon cycle; yet, unifying concepts driving molecular composition have yet to be established. We characterized 37 DOM isolates from diverse aquatic ecosystems, including their stable and radiocarbon isotopes ($\delta$13C-dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and $\Delta$14C-DOC), optical properties (absorbance and fluorescence), and molecular composition (ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry). Isolates encompassed end-members of allochthonous and autochthonous DOM from sites across the United States, the Pacific Ocean, and Antarctic lakes. Modern $\Delta$14C-DOC and optical properties reflecting increased aromaticity, such as carbon specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254), were directly related to polyphenolic and polycyclic aromatic compounds, whereas enriched $\delta$13C-DOC and optical properties reflecting autochthonous end-members were positively correlated to more aliphatic compounds. Furthermore, the two sets of autochthonous end-members (Pacific Ocean and Antarctic lakes) exhibited distinct molecular composition due to differences in extent of degradation. Across all sites and end-members studied, we find a consistent shift in composition with aging, highlighting the persistence of certain biomolecules concurrent with degradation time.},

abstract = {The questions that we ask as scientists shape everything that follows. They can lead us to see the world in new ways, or mundane ones. They can spur the development of new approaches, or the recycling of established ones. They can focus our attention in useful directions, or leave us wandering aimlessly. In science, as in everything else, what you find will largely depend on what you were looking for. Thus, sometimes one can be helpful simply by framing questions, even if—or especially if—the answers are not yet clear. My purpose here is to identify questions that I hope will be productive ones. I make no pretence of presenting answers. These questions have emerged from long hours pondering hydrochemical data like those shown in Figures 1 and 2. The same kinds of data have also been pondered by many others in our community, so I make no particular claim of originality for the observations that follow. I simply hope that presenting these observations in the following way may prove useful.},
