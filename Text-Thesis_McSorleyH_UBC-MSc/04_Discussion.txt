Discussion points

## Cragg Creek subbasin monitoring was located downstream from two relatively recent harvest areas (trees maybe 15 years old?). Did Cragg display a different pattern in DOC concentration on the rising limb? Was it consistent? 

## Weeks and Chris are both headwater tributaries to the Leech, but they appear to have very different hydrologic responses.... were their 'time to peak' similar? The wetlands attenuate lots of flow... and they're very different stream morphologies. Weeks is strongly connected to subsurface flow (as indicated by the seeps I found in the summer). 

## in terms of synchrony, was it similar in all subbasins? was it similar between Weeks + Chris / Leech Head + Tunnel / Cragg + Head + West Leech / was West Leech very different all around?
if Weeks and Chris were out of synch, was the head in synch with Cragg and Tunnel? 

##  Can I use the photos to also compare synchrony?

## At Cragg, if the falling limb samples are different, were they lower/higher/similar in concentration to rising limb?

## treatability metrics: comparing tunnel, judge, rithet -- google CRD water quality reports (public) any concerns about DBPs? Reservoir effects alter riverine source water treatability.

## look up other spectral indicies

Tobi:
	- With a coupled data-set, “rule-curves” can be created to support decisions about water diversion through the tunnel to ensure water quality drinking standards are maintained
