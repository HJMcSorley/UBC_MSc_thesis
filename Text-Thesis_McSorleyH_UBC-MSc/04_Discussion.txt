Discussion points

## Cragg Creek subbasin monitoring was located downstream from two relatively recent harvest areas (trees maybe 15 years old?). Did Cragg display a different pattern in DOC concentration on the rising limb? Was it consistent? 

## Weeks and Chris are both headwater tributaries to the Leech, but they appear to have very different hydrologic responses.... were their 'time to peak' similar? The wetlands attenuate lots of flow... and they're very different stream morphologies. Weeks is strongly connected to subsurface flow (as indicated by the seeps I found in the summer). 

## in terms of synchrony, was it similar in all subbasins? was it similar between Weeks + Chris / Leech Head + Tunnel / Cragg + Head + West Leech / was West Leech very different all around?
if Weeks and Chris were out of synch, was the head in synch with Cragg and Tunnel? 

##  Can I use the photos to also compare synchrony?

## At Cragg, if the falling limb samples are different, were they lower/higher/similar in concentration to rising limb?

## treatability metrics: comparing tunnel, judge, rithet -- google CRD water quality reports (public) any concerns about DBPs? Reservoir effects alter riverine source water treatability.

Like most forested areas on Vancouver Island, the Leech watershed is second-growth softwood forest with a history of extensive harvest (nearly 96% cleared).

	- With a coupled data-set, “rule-curves” can be created to support decisions about water diversion through the tunnel to ensure water quality drinking standards are maintained 

#### 2020-04-18
16 unique precipitation events were sampled, where each event was defined by rainfall greater than 50mm with a period of 14 hours between events. Half of these events (eight) were captured in the 2019 water year (2018-2019 wet season), the other half in the 2020 water year. Events were delineated (using USGS Rainmaker package, RMevents function, in R) based on mean 15-minute rainfall measured at Chris Creek and Martin's Gulch fire-weather stations (CRD provided data); it was assumed that rainfall was evenly distributed over the watershed and the average rainfall between the stations located at Leech headwaters and mouth were representative of rainfall over the entire water supply area.  

## SUVA-254
Molecules with greater aromaticity (i.e., greater density of conjugated pi bonds, e.g. humic substances??) will absorb more UV energy at wavelength 254nm than non-aromatic molecules. And because absorbance is proportional to the concentration of analyte in a sample, specific UV absorbance at 254nm (SUVA~254~) -- calculated by dividing absorbance at 254nm by the sample's DOC concentration -- is a widely adopted indicator of a sample's aromaticity. A greater SUVA~254~ value indicates a sample with more aromatic character than a sample with low SUVA~254~.
