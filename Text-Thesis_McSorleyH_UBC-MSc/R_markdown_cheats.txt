significant accomplishments:
-  completed 13 field trips for MSc river sampling,
- summer lake sampling (depth profile samples from three lakes) for algae and cyanobacteria, 
	- filter samples sent to U.Waterloo (Kirsten Muller's lab)
- two sets of treatability samples from four sites collected and shipped to U.Alberta and U.Waterloo for analyses,
- presented MSc project and interim result highlights at a CRD divisional meeting to field operations crews (invited by Annette Constabel, Senior Manager, Watershed Protection),
-  collected and analyzed 230 samples 

the work done to date contributes to our understanding of source water quality variability over time and space, and collaborative analyses provided specific details about treatability parameters (U of W) and DOM character (U of A). 

- interactions with other forWater network folks:
	- maintaining connections with other HQP and YP within the Network,
	- participation in HQP ST3 week, webinars and group calls

- interactions with forWater partner CRD: 
	- working with field ops crews during field trips,
