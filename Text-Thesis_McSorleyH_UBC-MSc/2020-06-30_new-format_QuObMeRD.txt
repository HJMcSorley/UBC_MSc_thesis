RQ 1: What are the ranges for DOC concentration and DOM character between adjacent drainage basins and among nested sub-catchments in the LWSA, and what influence does seasonality have on concentration and character of DOC?

Objective 1.0: Design a sampling strategy to measure the spatial and temporal variation of DOM & DOC.
Objective 1.1: Describe the variation and trends in DOC and DOM over space and time.


RQ2: (Assuming that hydrological processes are the main driver for DOC transport and variation in the LWSA) 
	Is there a mechanistic relationship between river stage and DOC? 

Objective 2.0: Relate water samples to river stage and report on the relationships between DOC concentrations and DOM character with stage, with attention to differences between baseflow and storm events.


RQ3: Are some watershed characteristics more important than others for driving DOM dynamics?

Objective 3.0: Assess the importance of watershed characteristics and conditions as explanatory variables for DOC and DOM patterns.

RQ4: What are the implications for watershed management and future drinking water supply?

Objective 4.0: Provide context of how results can be used to inform watershed management planning for wildfire reduction strategies and design of continued water quality monitoring for future inter-basin transfers.
