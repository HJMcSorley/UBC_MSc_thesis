Although sampling stage was directly related to rain conditions, in that more rain generated greater stream rise, rain was relatively more important as a predictor for DOC concentration than sampling stage was... this indicates that it may not have been the stage at which samples were collected, but rather at the antecedent wetness conditions (if you consider rain a proxy for wetness, which seems reasonable). 


antecedent 30-day rain MSE % = 12.87  // without stage: 13.5234 % MSE 
antecedent 7-day rain MSE % = 11.66  // without stage: 12.0837 % MSE

*these differences aren't huge but the change switched relative importance between rain and hold-time. 

this indicates that greater saturation, which may be indicative of the connectivity between streams and the terrestrial environment, was more important than precipitation inputs in general.

similarly for temp:
antecedent 7-day air temp 14.515475 % MSE
antecedent 30-day air temp 14.477188 % MSE

using the same parameters tuned for DOC prediction for VIM E2E3 -- temperature was not important but rain was. 
Like DOC predictions, 30-day antecedent rain was relatively more important predictor variable for E~2~:E~3~ than 7-day rain (15.3% vs. 12.8%). For E~2~:E~3~, 7-day antecedent air temperatures were more important than 30-day air temperatures (8.5% vs. 6.5%). Relatively short term temperatures and relatively long term rain were most important for predicting DOC concentrations. 
Relatively long term rain was most important for predicitng E~2~:E~3~, and sample hold-time was also an important predictor in NOM character. Logging history (percent of basin harvested from 1980-2011) and basin parent material was more important in predicting NOM character than concentration.

hysteresis:

- plot antecedent rain with date-time sampled to see what the relationship is. Then you can relate the direction of the hysteresis loop to the conditions (and thus to the hydrograph)

- the hysterestic pattern (temporal) was consistent among the six subbasins (spatial) * bigger loop/same??

concentration-discharge relationships can inform flow-paths and streamflow contributions (i.e. subsurface vs overland, near-stream vs. upland

For C-Q analysis, a minimum of five samples are required to determine the rotational direction of hysteresis (pre and post episode low flow, rising and falling limbs and close to peak Q). 

....
Hysteresis is a physical process in which changes to a variable lag behind the changes in it's causal affect; this creates a relationship where the path taken towards a certain point will not neccessarily be the path taken to return to the starting point. In hydrology, hysteresis is often evaluated with resepect to  concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships to assess changes in solute concentrations across a hydrograph [@Evans1999].  C-Q relationships can provide information about flow-paths and streamflow component contributions (i.e. subsurface vs. overland flow, or connectivity to near-stream vs. upland areas). Evans et al [-@Evans1999] determined that a minimum of five samples are required to determine the rotational direction of a hysteresis curve: pre- and post-episode low flows, rising and falling limbs and close to peak flow.

hysteresis may also result from simple component mixing, where contributions from di?erent ¯ow sources peak at di?erent times (Walling and Webb, 1986; Swistock et al., 1989; Hooper et al., 1990). Evans and Davies (1998) have identi®ed the forms of hysteresis that can be produced within the constraints of various types oftwo-component (2CM) and three-component model (3CM)

intra-storm DOC (^13^C~DOC~) closely resemble riparian soil quality during that event. 

  
>80% of stream DOC originated in superficial soil horizones of the riparian domain, and the riparian soil DOC included material from upland and riparian sources.
 Upland DOC contributions decreased from the beginning of the high-flow period to the end of high-flows.
 
 
** stream DOC has major contributions from upland domains, but that upland source pool is a size-limited reservoir. In contrast, riparian and wetland dominated areas act as a near-infinite NOM reservoir. 

Allochthonous inputs are dominant in headwater catchments [Aitkenhead et al., 1999; Billett et al., 2006)]and most of the export occurs during rain or melt events [Raymond and Saiers, 2010]


I have no data from which to infer hydrologic connectivity between upland portions of the Leech catchments with the streams... just specualtion. 

* autochthonous NOM could also originate near-stream in riparian areas


upland portions of the catchment contribute to stream DOC, but the dominant sources are the riparian zones 

observed in France (Lambert) and coastal California -- (Sanderman et al. 2008, 2009)  --  seasonal depletion of upland DOC pool, graual depletion in stream though hydrologic connectivity remained high during that period.

For example, the release of microbial DOC may explain the DOC peaks observed in wet- land soils after dry summers (Kalbitz et al., 2000). As

Results of this research show that Vertical Rack sampling stations coupled with synoptic grab sampling campaigns provide a reliable method for measuring water quality changes over time and across events. A key limitation of Vertical Rack sampling is isolation of siphon sample collection to only the rising hydrograph limb, additionally, high water can prohibit safe retrieval of colelcted samples from the Racks. Coupling mulitple monitoring sites provided good spatial resolution to accompany the event- and synoptic-based temporal resolution of sampling....

I wonder if the higher molecular weight at the end of the wet season is indicative of potential intra-event shift from lower molecular weight NOM on the rising limb to higher MW, more aromatic NOM on the falling limb (possible shift between new/old water?)

solute concentrations often show hysteresis with streamflow
this is sometimes refered to as concentration-discharge, or 'C-Q', relationships .

antecedent wetness conditions are linked to streamflow and hydrologic connectivity to upland source pools of solutes, particularaly terrigeneous NOM.

thus, in the absense of streaflow-solute data, perhaps antecedent condion data could reveal similar patterns of hysteresis. 

higher antecedent wettness corresponds to greater hydrologic connectivity to streamflow  

so and so said that 5 points were the minimum required to evaluate C-Q hysterestic behaviour, so long as the five points represented the event well (i.e. low-flow pre-event, rising limb, near-peakflow, falling limb,

Oswald et al. (2011), showed for a 0.8 km2 catchment in north- western Ontario, Canada, that a large part of the catchment area was hydrologically disconnected from the stream during most events, and that there was a threshold catchment stor- age at which a larger area contributed to streamflow


Interpretations of hydrologic connectivity are often based on such changes in stream water chemistry (Uhlenbrook et al., 2004; Soulsby et al., 2007; Pacific et al., 2010).

For in- stance, McGlynn and McDonnell (2003) used silica concentrations and isotope data for a 2.6 ha sub-catchment of the Maimai catchment in New Zealand to show that the contributions from the hillslopes were larger for an event with higher wetness conditions than for an event with drier initial conditions and were also larger on the falling limb of the hydrograph

Zuecco et al. (2019) showed that the increase in subsurface connectivity was delayed compared to stream- flow (anticlockwise hysteresis) for two sub-catchments of the Studibach catchment in Switzerland, suggesting that hills- lope runoff may not be the dominant runoff source at the be- ginning of rainfall events for these small catchments.


However, the events were smaller than the 50mm threshold for large contributions of event water to streamflow (Fischer et al., 2017).
