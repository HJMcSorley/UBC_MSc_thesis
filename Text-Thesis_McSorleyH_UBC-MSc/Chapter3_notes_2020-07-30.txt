RF

although sampling stage was directly related to rain conditions, in that more rain generated greater stream rise, rain was relatively more important as a predictor for DOC concentration than sampling stage was... this indicates that it may not have been the stage at which samples were collected, but rather at the antecedent wetness conditions (if you consider rain a proxy for wetness, which seems reasonable). 

RF can sometimes find biased VIM if predictor variables are cross-correlated, and rain and stage were correlated (0.61 Pearson correlation coefficient), so RF VIM was run with only sampling stage, and with only antecedent 30-day rain and in both scenarios, each variable ranked at the same relative importance for predicting DOC.

different periods of time were considered for antecedent conditions, and 30-day antecedent rain was a more important predictor for DOC than 7 day rain

antecedent 30-day rain MSE % = 12.87  // without stage: 13.5234 % MSE 
antecedent 7-day rain MSE % = 11.66  // without stage: 12.0837 % MSE

*these differences aren't huge but the change switched relative importance between rain and hold-time. 

this indicates that greater saturation, which may be indicative of the connectivity between streams and the terrestrial environment, was more important than precipitation inputs in general.

similarly for temp:
antecedent 7-day air temp 14.515475 % MSE
antecedent 30-day air temp 14.477188 % MSE

using the same parameters tuned for DOC prediction for VIM E2E3 -- temperature was not important but rain was. 
Like DOC predictions, 30-day antecedent rain was relatively more important predictor variable for E~2~:E~3~ than 7-day rain (15.3% vs. 12.8%). For E~2~:E~3~, 7-day antecedent air temperatures were more important than 30-day air temperatures (8.5% vs. 6.5%). Relatively short term temperatures and relatively long term rain were most important for predicting DOC concentrations. 
Relatively long term rain was most important for predicitng E~2~:E~3~, and sample hold-time was also an important predictor in NOM character. Logging history (percent of basin harvested from 1980-2011) and basin parent material was more important in predicting NOM character than concentration.

antecedent 30-day rain MSE = 16.440 %
antecedent 30-day air temp MSE = 6.525875 % 

antecedent 30-day rain MSE = 15.330895 %
antecedent 7-day air temp MSE = 8.486056 % 

antecedent 7-day rain MSE = 12.786768 % 
antecedent 7-day air temp MSE = 9.834241 %
 
 
 ?? Does wark gneiss have relatively great  or weak hydraulic conductivity??
