Aqueous forms of NOM in freshwater play important ecological roles but can be problematic for drinking water treatment because they increase oxidant demand (e.g. chlorination), contribute to the formation of disinfection by-products, and cause other disruptions (e.g. short filter run times, microbial bio-fouling, coagulant demand). Because the backbone of NOM is carbon, DOC is a measure of the dissolved forms of NOM in a sample. While quantifying a sample's DOC is important in describing the amount of NOM, it tells us nothing about the structure (and therefore the function) of that material. Characterizing molecular attributes in addition to quantifying NOM provides greater insight than quantification alone; therefore, both quantification of DOC and characterization of NOM were tackled for this project.
