Streamflow events were primarily generated by rain in the Leech WSA, with the watershed responding rapidly to inputs. Synoptic sampling was conducted every two to four weeks, but relying only scheduled synoptic sampling could miss interesting NOM changes during the rising limb of the hydrograph. Furthermore, the logistics of Grab sampling through events at multiple sites would have been challenging for one person to accomplish, could have been dangerous due to high flows, and would have required site access beyond safe working hours (i.e. not logistically feasible). However, it was important to sample across the hydrograph to capture sample-sets that represented variation in DOC and NOM that occurred during changing flow conditions (i.e. within storm variability). Based on cost, logistical considerations and curiosity, siphon sampling strategies were employed at the monitoring sites across the Leech WSA.

###### Drainage area

Sub-basin drainage area was ranked third for predicting DOC and SAC~254~, and fourth in variable importance for E~2~:E~3~. The relationships between drainage area and NOM concentration and character were examined and no patterns were evident (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMareaRIDGE)).

Increasing DOC on the rising limb indicates that source material is not limited and flux is driven by hydrologic connectivity; whereas source limited conditions likely drive NOM dynamics if DOC concentration decreases on the rising limb [@Zarnetske2018]. 

antecedent 30-day rain MSE % = 12.87  // without stage: 13.5234 % MSE 
antecedent 7-day rain MSE % = 11.66  // without stage: 12.0837 % MSE
*these differences aren't huge but the change switched relative importance between rain and hold-time. 

Relatively long term rain was most important for predicitng E~2~:E~3~, and sample hold-time was also an important predictor in NOM character. Logging history (percent of basin harvested from 1980-2011) and basin parent material was more important in predicting NOM character than concentration.

Surface water samples were collected between October 2018 and February 2020 to measure dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and natural organic matter (NOM) character through space and time in the Greater Victoria Water Supply Area (GVWSA).Samples were analyzed at UBC for DOC concentration and NOM character via high temperature combustion and UV-Vis spectroscopy, respectively. The sampling program designed for this project included synoptic sampling of 12 sites across the Sooke and Leech water supply areas (WSA), as well as installation of monitoring and sampling stations at 6 sites in the Leech WSA. Results of synoptic sampling analyses were used to elucidate spatial and temporal patterns in NOM and DOC.

Aqueous forms of NOM in freshwater play important ecological roles but can be problematic for drinking water treatment because they increase oxidant demand (e.g. chlorination), contribute to the formation of disinfection by-products, and cause other disruptions (e.g. short filter run times, microbial bio-fouling, coagulant demand). Because the backbone of NOM is carbon, DOC is a measure of the dissolved forms of NOM in a sample. While quantifying a sample's DOC is important in describing the amount of NOM, it tells us nothing about the structure (and therefore the function) of that material. Characterizing molecular attributes in addition to quantifying NOM provides greater insight than quantification alone; therefore, both quantification of DOC and characterization of NOM were tackled for this project.

An intense atmospheric river event hit the LWSA January 29-31 (event 17, Table \@ref(tab:EventsTable3)) and generated incredible flows across the Leech watershed (and across southern Vancouver Island). Streamflow at CraggCrk (site 4) and the Tunnel (site 6) over-topped the 2 m vertical racks and ripped the level-loggers out of their stilling wells. Luckily, the level-loggers were found downstream in February and (after drying the circuit boards) the data were successfully retrieved from both Odyssey loggers. Following event 17, changes to the stream-bed morphology were evident at LeechHead (site 3) in the form of gravel and cobble deposition, there was evidence of substantial coarse woody debris transport at ChrisCrk (site 2), and destruction to hydrologic monitoring equipment at the Leech Tunnel.

* variability among sub-basins versus variability within each sub-basin over time
* timing of peaks and valleys of stage -- at 10 min resolution was there a lag from upstream to downstream?
* source versus transport limitations -- DOC in rising limb
* any hysteretic behaviour? (DOC over time by event)
* was there a relationship between rain event intensity/duration and DOC?
* use RF to in-fill missing NOM absorbance data based on relationship with DOC??? Like Yeonuk did for CH4 flux

The wet season was better represented than the dry by sample number and was therefore more interesting in terms of DOC concentration patterns. Additionally, the wet season water quality is most relevant with respect to water supply because that is when flows are great enough to allow diversion for inter-basin transfer. High flows during the wet season also showed increased DOC concentrations relative to low flows; stormflow samples collected on vertical Racks showed higher DOC than Grab samples manually collected across wet seasons (Figure \@ref(fig:subbasinSampletypeBox).

### Spatial & temporal patterns in DOC & NOM

Highest concentrations and variance in DOC occurred at the Weeks Main creek headwater site (Weeks, site 1), a sub-basin in the northwest of the Leech watershed which includes Weeks Lake and surrounding wetlands. Lowest average concentration and variance in DOC was recorded at Cragg Creek (CraggCrk, site 4), a mainstem river that drains the east sub-basin of the Leech watershed including Jarvis Lake and the western slopes of Survey Mountain. DOC concentration and variance at Leech River Tunnel (Tunnel, site 6) was somewhat between that at WestLeech and CraggCrk (Figure \@ref(fig:subbasinDOCbox)).

\  

```{r subbasinDOCbox, fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:subbasinDOCbox} *Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations across the Leech watershed over sixteen months, collected by standard grab sampling and on vertical racks (318 samples total).*"

```

\  

DOC concentrations followed similar sinusoidal trends over time at each site, with amplitude of variation decreasing from upstream to downstream sites (Figure \@ref(fig:DOCloess)).     

```{r DOCloess, fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:DOCloess} *Trends in dissolved organic carbon concentrations over sixteen months (Oct 2018 to Feb 2020) at six sites across the Leech water supply area. Trend lines represents locally weighted smoothing ('loess' method of local polynomial regression).*"

#### River stage, DOC & NOM

In general, DOC concentrations increased with increasing stage across the LWSA, thought the patterns were not necessarily linear and not always consistent. The relationships between spectral indicators of NOM character and stage showed tighter patterns than DOC concentration with stage at all sites, but again the relationships were not linear (Figure \@ref(fig:stageRelations)). ...___I don’t actually see that pattern at all in those figures – not sure you can do hysteresis plots with the data you have, but you should try___....

```{r stageRelations, fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:stageRelations} *Relationships between river stage and sample DOC concentrations and NOM character. Data for each variable were normalized (min-max normalization) to clarify relative scales in each relationship. None of the relationships were were linear, some had more large variance and some variables remained consistent with changing stage.*"

### Remove until you fix this

To get a better idea of stream surge NOM dynamics, well sampled rising limb stream surges were examined... 
* mid wet 2018
Trip 4 // rain event 3 [for sites 1-5] 
Trip 5 // rain event 4 for Tunnel

* earlier 2019
rain events 10 & 11 (maybe)


To better understand how timing of peak DOC varied among sites during the wet season, a subset of samples was selected for closer analysis (highlighted in Figure \@ref(fig:extremaplot) and expanded in Figure \@ref(fig:subsetExtremaplot)). The subset included samples from rain events 10-12; a subset deemed to be representative of DOC concentrations and rain events across the wet seasons, as there were no significant differences between DOC concentrations or rain events (amount and intensity) for this subset of samples compared to the rest of the study period (Table \@ref(tab:subbsetWilcox)). There were significant differences in UV~254~ absorbance for events 10-12 compared to the rest of the study period, therefore this subset was not considered representative of spectral trends overall and was only examined for DOC trends.

Spatially, DOC and SAC~254~ decreased from low- to high-order streams during both wet and dry seasons; in contrast, E~2~:E~3~ had opposite patterns in the wet and dry seasons. From upstream to downstream, E~2~:E~3~ showed aromaticity increased in the dry-season and decreased in the wet-season. As indicators of aromaticity, the key difference between SAC~254~ and E~2~:E~3~ is that E~2~:E~3~ accounts for absorbance at 365 nm wavelength which corresponds to larger and more aromatic molecules. So, the different patterns observed for E~2~:E~3~ and SAC~254~ in the wet season suggests that relatively smaller aromatic NOM (measured by SAC~254~) was depleted along the reach  


early on, peak stage was more associated with DOC min, and later on it was more associated with DOC max.
