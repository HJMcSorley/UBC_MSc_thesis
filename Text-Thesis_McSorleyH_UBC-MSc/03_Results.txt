## DOC concentrations 

### 	Synoptic sample overview

* space
* time
* mean +/- sd DOC

### Subbasin DOC concentrations 

* RCC theories supported or no?
* synchronized increased in DOC?
* all rising limb increase or some different? -- source limited OC or hydro?

####	QA/QC 	hold-time experiments 
####	QA?QC 	temperature (the river as a refrigerator) 

## Hydrologic response and spatiotemporal synchrony (CRD provided weather station data)

### 	storm delineation
###	 	IDF
