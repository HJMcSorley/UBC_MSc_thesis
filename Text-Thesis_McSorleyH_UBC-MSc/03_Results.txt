# Data and Results

The primary objectives of this project was to characterize the range of hydrochemical dynamics and synchrony during rainfall response among sub-basins ranging in size from 9.6 to 37 km^2^.  To understand spatial and temporal patterns in hydrochemical dynamics, this research was tackled in two key ways: (1) six sub-basin sites were equipped with vertical racks which logged river stage, air and water temperature at 10-minute intervals and passively collected whole water samples during stormflow on rising limbs of the hydrograph;  and  (2) fifteen sites, including the six sub-basin sites, were sampled synoptically every two to four weeks. Results of both the synoptic sampling and sub-basin monitoring were used to characterize the temporal and spatial range of DOC concentrations and DOM character. In addition to spatiotemporal dynamics, the sub-basin monitoring sites were used to evaluate hydrologic responses based on  river rise (stream stage) and local precipitation. The vertical racks installed at the sub-basin sites enhanced the synoptic sampling program by collecting samples during rainfall-induced hydrologic surges -- samples which would have been challenging and dangerous to collect manually at locations across the watershed. DOC concentration trends in stormflow were indicative of whether aqueous DOM was supply-limited or governed by hydrologic forcing. The data collected were used to elucidate spatiotemporal synchrony among sub-catchments. 

\  

Sixteen months of bi-weekly field work was completed with the goals of contributing to the characterization of the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA) while furthering our understanding of the variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in hydrologic response across a second growth forested watershed. From November 2018 to February 2020, four hundred and fifty-five water samples (Table YYY ) were collected and analyzed for DOC concentration and DOM character by high temperature combustion and UV-Vis spectroscopy (respectively), while an additional 42 samples were analyzed at an external laboratory for a suite of total metals.

## Hydroclimatic Regime, Stage & Sampling

The Capital Regional District provided data from their fire-weather stations within the LWSA. Figure *CCC* shows snow, air temperature and rain during the study period, as well as river stage and sampling points at each of the six subbasins. 

![__Figure CCC__Weather in the watershed with river rise and samples at the six sub-basin sites_](R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/Wx-stage_subbasins_megaplot.png)

\  

The weather data plotted in Figure *CCC* are arithmetic means from two fire-weather stations in the LWSA: Chris Creek (in the headwaters) and Martin's Gulch (near the mouth/ future point of diversion).  Figure NNN shows precipitation and temperature measured at each of these two stations over 2018 and 2019, with this study's period highlighted.  Table *JJJ* summarizes data from each of these two stations by calender year.

```

\  

The arithmetic means for precipitation and air temperature from each of the two weather stations in the LWSA is summarized in Table UUU (where standard deviations represent the difference between the two stations, not the full annual dataset). The station means are plotted in Figure MMM.  The mean values were used for analysis including delineating storm events.

## DOC concentrations
### Spatiotemporal patterns
* synoptic sampling overview (full study period)
* higher concentrations in lower order streams
* decreasing concentrations over the wet season
* what was the variability within low-order streams versus higher-order streams? was there greater variability within each site than between them?

### vertical rack samples
At the six sub-basin monitoring sites, vertical racks were installed to collect samples as the rivers rose in response to precipitation events.
These vertical racks collected samples on the rising hydrograph limb, which has been shown to have higher DOC concentration that non-storm flow [@Yang2015; @Raymond2016; @Raymond2010]. As the vertical racks require a hydrologic response to collect samples, they are only applicable during the wet season.

			   "max DOC (mg/L)"),
               caption = "Summary of synoptic grab sample DOC concentrations")
```

### Rising limb trends (supply/hydro controls)
* was the trend for conc on RL consistent at each site across the study period or did it change from early in the wet season to later?
* did each of the six subbasin sites have similar RL trends?  

### DOC and metals concentrations  -------------------------------------------metals

### DOC and metals in solution

Aquatic NOM can play an important role in the transport of metals because it has the physiochemical ability to act as a ligand to create coordinated complexes with metals. From November 2018 to July 2019, I collected eight sets of samples for metals analysis from the six sub-basin monitoring sites. Metals samples were collected on behalf of the CRD and were analyzed at Bureau Veritas Laboratories in Sidney, BC (formerly Maxxam Analytics Inc.). For each metals sample collected, a parallel Grab sample was analyzed for DOC. There was a suite of metals included in the analyses, many of which were below detection limits; Figure XXXXX shows DOC concentrations from samples which had detectable concentrations of eight metal species.   

![__Figure__Concentrations of DOC and total metals_](R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/DOC-Metals_subbasin_scatterplots.png)
\  

DOC concentrationshad strong positive relationships with total mercury (R^2^=0.9998, n=3) aluminum (R^2^=0.81, n=36), and iron (R^2^=0.72, n=36). While the relationships were not as strong, DOC was also positively related to concentrations of copper (R^2^=0.47, n=27), barium (R^2^=0.25, n=30), and manganese (R^2^=0.21, n=12). Not included in FIGUREYYYYYY is the weak inverse relationship between DOC and silicon (R^2^=0.061, n=29) and magnesium (R^2^=0.015, n=30). All metals concentrations were below maximum allowable concentrations and aesthetic objectives for source water guidelines [@BC2019].


# -----------------------------------------------
## DOM character (& seasonality)
### SUVA (aromaticity)
**** note that the correlation between DOC and metals becomes even tighter when SUVA is used instead of NPOC... greater aromaticity indicates greater potential for complexation (aromatic ~ ligand)
### E2:E3 (molecular weight)
 * I'm not sure how to interpret these.... seem to be pretty similar, with maybe a bit more variance later in the season????


## Hydrologic Response & flow ranking
* flow ranking based on one synoptic streamflow gauging campaign (likely to match stream-order?)
### stage not Q
* using stage data rather than flow indicates a general response but doesn't provide the same level of detail that discharge values could.
### storm delineation by rainfall
* how storms were defined
* how many did I capture
* time-to-peak at each subbasin
### synchrony of nested sub-catchments
* synchrony based on mean variance of stage among the subbasin sites

## Treatability study
* how did the 2 future sites (Tunnel and Deception) compare to the 2 current sites (Rithet and Judge)? 
* Reservoir effects create more stable source water conditions, despite sometimes dramatic changes in source tributary water quality. Understanding the hydrochemical residence time, water balance, and mixing dynamics of the Sooke Reservoir is key to understanding how variable source tributary water quality could effect treatability.

# Weather
## CRD F-Wx stations

Two stations collect precipitation and temperature data, Chris Creek weather station is located in the headwaters of the Leech watershed and Martin's Gulch is located near the future point of diversion. 
 
```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.pos="h"}
knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/Wx_LWSA.png")
```
```{r}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/Wx_LWSA-summary.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```  
As there were too few stations to estimate watershed precipitation via Theissen polygons or isohyetal lines, arithmetic means were calculated based on data from Chris Creek and Martin's Gulch stations. It was assumed that the arithmethic means of precipitation and temperatures were representative of conditions across the Leech watershed.

### Malahat 5 year weather
The Leech WSA fire-weather stations were recently installed and therefore weather during this study period could not be compared to a record from previous years. A nearby weather station (Malahat) had data from 2014 which was used to check if weather the study period was consistent with previous trends.
