New chapter - Chapter 3: River stage dynamics with DOC & DOM


Additionally, time-stamps of event-based samples were used to inform stage-concentration relationships (Chapter 3).

...
The rising limb has been shown to have higher DOC concentration than low flows between storm pulses [@Yang2015; @Raymond2016; @Raymond2010; @Zarnetske2018]. Increasing DOC on the rising limb indicates that source material is not limited and flux is driven by hydrologic connectivity; whereas source limited conditions likely drive DOM dynamics if DOC concentration decreases on the rising limb [@Zarnetske2018]. Analysis of rack samples clarifies the magnitude and direction of water quality changes in response to precipitation relative, which provides information about solute supply and hydrologic connectivity [@Vidon2008; @Abbott2018; @Creed2015; @Zarnetske2018].

Additionally, event-based river samples collected near-simultaneously at sites across a watershed can provide insights about relative hydrologic pulse responses across nested catchments [@Abbott2018]....
