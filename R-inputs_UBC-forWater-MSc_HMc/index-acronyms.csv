Acronym , Term , Definition 
NOM,natural organic matter,"diverse carbon-based compounds found in natural, engineered, terrestrial and aquatic environments "
DOM ,dissolved organic matter ,organic compounds operationally defined as finer than 0.45 um in diameter
DOC,dissolved organic carbon ,organic carbon compounds operationally defined as finer than 0.45 um in diameter. The majority of DOM is DOC.
NPOC,non-purgeable organic carbon ,"instrumental parameter measured to quantify organic carbon (e.g. on a Shimadzu TOC-V analyzer). An aqueous sample is acidified to below pH 2 to convert inorganic carbon (e.g. carbonates) to carbon dioxide (CO2), the sample is then sparged with hydrocarbon-free air to drive off CO2, then the sample is combusted at high temperatures to convert the remaining organic carbon to CO2 which is detected with a non-dispersive infrared gas analyzer."
DBP-FP ,Disinfection By-Product Formation Potential ,"The likelihood of creating DBPs(e.g. trihalomethanes, halogenic acetic acids, Haloacetonitrils, haloketons) when natural source water is chlorinated "
LWSA,Leech Water Supply Area ,Future water supply area anticipated to supplement the primary water supply (Sooke Reservoir) for the Greater Victoria Area via inter-basin transfer. LWSA is the research site for this thesis' field work. 
CRD ,Capital Regional District ,"The governing/municipal body for the Greater Victoria Area, and the managing group for water supply and watershed management. The CRD are partners in the forWater Network and hosted this thesis research in the Leech Water Supply Area."
GVWSA ,Greater Victoria Water Supply Area ,"20,549 hectares of protected drinking water catchment lands owned and operated by the Capital Regional District. Includes the Sooke Lake watershed and reservoir (primary supply source), Goldstream watershed and reservoir system (secondary supply) and the Leech River watershed (future water supply area, and the study site of this thesis research) "
