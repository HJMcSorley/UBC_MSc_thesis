Acronym , Term ,Definition 
NOM,Natural Organic Matter,"diverse carbon-based compounds found in natural, engineered, terrestrial and aquatic environments "
DOM ,Dissolved Organic Matter ,organic compounds operationally defined as finer than 0.45 um in diameter
DOC,Dissolved Organic Carbon ,organic carbon portion of dissolved organic matter (the majority of DOM is DOC)
NPOC,Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon ,"instrumentally measured parameter to quantify organic carbon (with Shimadzu TOC-V analyzer): aqueous sample is acidified (pH <2) to convert inorganic carbon (e.g. carbonates) to carbon dioxide and then sparged with hydrocarbon-free air to remove CO2, then the remaining organic carbon is combusted to CO2 which is detected with a non-dispersive infrared gas analyzer."
DBPs,Disinfection By-Products,"group of unintentional halogenated organic compounds resulting from chlorination of source drinking water (e.g. trihalomethanes, halogenic acetic acids, Haloacetonitrils, haloketons)"
DBP-FP ,Disinfection By-Product Formation Potential ,experimentally predicted amount of DBPs created through chlorination
LWSA,Leech Water Supply Area ,future supplemental water supply area for the Greater Victoria Area & the main research site for this research project
CRD ,Capital Regional District ,governing/municipal body for the Greater Victoria Area and the managing group for water supply and watershed management. Research partners in the forWater Network & hosts for this thesis research in the LWSA
GVWSA ,Greater Victoria Water Supply Area ,"20,549 hectares of protected drinking water catchment lands owned and operated by the CRD (including Sooke Lake reservoir (primary supply source), Goldstream watershed and reservoir system (secondary supply) and LWSA) "
QA/QC,Quality Assurance & Quality Control,"methods of providing confidence in the quality of results, both are part of quality management (QA is more process oriented, QC is more product oriented) "
