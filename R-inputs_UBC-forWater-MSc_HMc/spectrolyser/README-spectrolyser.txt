this folder ("spectrolyser") belongs in the R-inputs directory for Hannah's Master's research 
("UBC_MSc/Thesis_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/R_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/R-inputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc")

This folder contains .csv files and .par files (one .par file was saved as a text file). 
Files are organized by trip numbers (field trips to the Leech WSA). 
The .csv files each contain sample identifiers for analyses completed on the Scan Spectrolyser in ESB 3062; corresponding raw results files (.par) exported from the spectrolyser software. 
Note - read .par files as tab delimited text files.

Some trip samples were not analyzed on the spectrolyser and some trips were but the results were accidentally overwritten by a lab-mate.
