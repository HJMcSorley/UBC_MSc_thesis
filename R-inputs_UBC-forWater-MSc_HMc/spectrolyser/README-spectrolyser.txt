*Some trip samples were not analyzed on the spectrolyser and some trips were but the results were accidentally overwritten by a lab-mate.


This directory contains two key sub-directories: "samples" and "results".

samples -- sample data includes order of analysis and sample identifier data in .csv files organized by trip number (field trips to the Leech).
results -- results data was exported from the UBC ESB-3062 EcoHydrology Lab Spectrolyser as .par files (also organized by trip numbers).


Unused directory, "Waste", contains .fp files (results) and garbage duplicate files.
