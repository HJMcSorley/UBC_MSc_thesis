Term,Definition
Absorbance,"molecular interference with a beam of light in which a molecule absorbs a portion of irradiated light (UV-VIS spectroscopy employs this attribute to quantify compounds, as absorbance is proportional to molecular concentration via Beers Law)"
Spectroscopy,"quantitative and/or qualitative analytical techniques relying on the interaction of matter with electromagnetic radiation (e.g. light). Generally, preserves the measured sample (can be used in-line with other analyses)"
Turbidity,"optical measurement of the ""cloudiness"" or clarity of water used as a proxy for total suspended solids. Measures the reduction in a beam of light based on particle-based light scattering to establish the amount of suspended material"
Total suspended solids (TSS),"particles that are suspended in the water column (generally, fine sediments will transport further downstream than coarse sediments)"
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC),organic carbon compounds that are operationally defined as being finer than 0.45 micron
Discharge / Streamflow,"the volume of water moving through a river channel over a defined period of time. In general, river discharge is computed by multiplying the area of water in a channel cross section by the average velocity of the water in that cross section, expressed in units of volume per time (e.g. cubic meters per second)"
Stream stage,"water level above an arbitrary point (e.g. bottom of a stilling well, streambed, step)"
Chromophore,"part of a molecule (structure) that absorbs visible light and is responsible for molecular colour (function). Chromophores are generally conjugated pi-bond systems in the molecule, commonly aromatic structures. UV-Vis absorbance measurements can be a proxy for molecular aromaticity because of the relationship between aromaticity and chromophoric absorbance."
Autochthonous,natural organic matter (NOM) that is formed in place (in stream) generally by micro-organisms
Allochthonous,natural organic matter (NOM) that is formed  outside of a water body and then transported into the water body; composition depends on the plant-derived precursor compounds and natural diagenetic processes that alter its composition
Pi Bond,"a covalent bond formed by the side-to-side overlap of two atomic orbitals (versus a sigma bond is a covalent bond formed by head-on overlap of two atomic orbitals; note that every single bond (e.g. C-C) consists of one sigma bond, a double bond (e.g. C=C) is made of one sigma bond and one pi bond, and a triple bond consists of one sigma bond and two pi bonds). Adjacent pi binds can lead to increased molecular stability (through resonance structures), aromaticity, and chromophores."
Natural Organic Matter,"diverse carbon-based compounds found in natural, engineered, terrestrial and aquatic environments "
Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon ,"instrumentally measured parameter to quantify organic carbon (with Shimadzu TOC-V analyzer): aqueous sample is acidified (pH <2) to convert inorganic carbon (e.g. carbonates) to carbon dioxide and then sparged with hydrocarbon-free air to remove CO2, then the remaining organic carbon is combusted to CO2 which is detected with a non-dispersive infrared gas analyzer."
Disinfection By-Products,"group of unintentional halogenated organic compounds resulting from chlorination of source drinking water (e.g. trihalomethanes, halogenic acetic acids, haloacetonitriles, haloketones)"
Disinfection By-Product Formation Potential ,experimentally predicted amount of DBPs created through chlorination of source water
Leech Water Supply Area ,future supplemental water supply area for the Greater Victoria Area & the main research site for this research project
Capital Regional District ,governing/municipal body for the Greater Victoria Area and the managing group for water supply and watershed management. Research partners in the forWater Network & hosts for this thesis research 
Greater Victoria Water Supply Area ,"20,549 hectares of protected drinking water catchment lands owned and operated by the CRD (including Sooke Lake reservoir (primary supply source), Goldstream watershed and reservoir system (secondary supply) and LWSA) "
Quality Assurance & Quality Control,"methods of providing confidence in the quality of results, both are part of quality management (QA is more process oriented; QC is more product oriented) "
High density polyethylene (sample bottles),plastic material that is impact resistant with good chemical compatibility. Suitable bottle material for water sample collection. 
Relative standard deviation (a.k.a coefficient of variance),"An expression of standard deviation relative to the mean, expressed as a percentage (RSD = (sd/mean)*100)"
Aromatic,class of hydrocarbons characterized by presence of conjugated pi-bonds with a ring structure (e.g. benzene C6H6)
Aliphatic,"class of hydrocarbons characterized by lack of conjugated pi-bonds, which could be straight-chain, branched chain or saturated ring structures (e.g. squalene C30H50)"
Random Forest,Statistical machine learning algorithm (collection of classification and regression trees)
