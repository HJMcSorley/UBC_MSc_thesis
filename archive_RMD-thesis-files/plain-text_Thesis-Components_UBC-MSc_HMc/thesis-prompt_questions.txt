# Decribe your watershed
	drainage area for the whole watershed, and the (sub) catchments
	stream orders
	ecoregion
	history of disturbance and time of recovery / regeneration
	hydroclimatic regime (obtain precip data for Chris Creek / Survey Mountain / Martin's Gultch)

Watershed Cumulative Effects Assessment
"The lack of long-term monitoring data and data inconsistencies were identified as frequently limiting factors for the advancement of WCEA science and the application of WCEA." -- SOIL-515 rev.paper.5

Salvage Harvest vs Timbre sales harvest:
it seems that salvage logging can have a more detrimental effect than regular harvesting. Compare and contrast salvage logging to resource harvesting as an argument for managing firebreaks within a drinking water watershed. 

Equivalent Clearcut area (BC and AB) -- see Zang 2012 (cumulative effects)
