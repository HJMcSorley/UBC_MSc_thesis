# Background: forWater Network for Forested Drinking Water Source Protection Technologies

The forWater Network is a cross-Canada collaborative research network designed to gain insights about drinking source water treatability as it relates to forest management. Forest management includes (but is not limited to) timber harvesting strategies, forest regeneration and replanting, pre-commercial thinning and treatments, and preventative risk reduction. The forWater Network aims to evaluate the impacts that forest management has on fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrients, as well as composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and turbidity, as these are key parameters that can create impediments to effective drinking water treatment and disinfection. The anticipated outcome of the forWater Network is to inform a range of treatability scenarios and implications.   

The forWater Network is a transdisciplinary organization composed of four research themes that collaborate to understand the link between forested source water quality and drinking water treatability. 
	Theme-1: Watershed Science & Forest Management 
	Theme-2: Downstream Effects Propagation
	Theme-3: Water Treatability
	Theme-4: Resource Economics
	
The forWater Network ("forWater") offers the ability to leverage the "economy of scale" by completing collaborative sample collection, analyses, and data sharing. Theme-1 research groups complete field work and sampling campaigns and share samples with Themes 2 & 3 for specialized analyses, the results of which are circulated back to Theme-1 and passed to Theme-4 for financial evaluations.  The research presented in this thesis contributes to objectives of Theme-1 (Watershed Science and Forest Management). All research conducted for this masters project was done in collaboration with the Capital Regional District (CRD) in the Greater Victoria Water Supply Area. 

# Study Site: the Leech River Watershed, future water supply area (Leech Water Supply Area)

The Leech River watershed is located on south-east Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The area is in the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone, where the hydroclimatic regime is rain-dominated (pluvial). Annual rainfall is typically between xxxx - yyyy mm (~2500 mm/yr). This areas has a strong seasonal distribution of rainfall: approximately 90% of rain falls from September to April, with only about 10% of annual rainfall occurring from May to August.  

The Leech River watershed is adjacent to Sooke Lake Reservoir, which is the primary water supply for the Greater Victoria Area (owned and managed by the Capital Regional District). In anticipation of future water demands and uncertainty related to rainfall and climate change, the Capital Regional District (CRD) purchased the majority of the Leech River watershed in **2007 and 2010**, and designated the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA) as future supplemental water supply. The Leech Tunnel was constructed in the 1980's to accomplish an inter-basin transfer of Leech River water into the Sooke watershed.  The Tunnel is not operational, and inter-basin transfer is anticipated for approximately year 2050. 

The Leech River system is composed of three main stem rivers, numerous tributaries, and four small headwater lakes. The rivers of LWSA are flashy: they respond rapidly to rain events, rising and falling dramatically. The hydrology of the LWSA is poorly understood, as is the water quality. In the mid-1980's, some water was transfered from the Leech River into Deception Gulch and Reservoir (adjacent but physically separated from Sooke Reservoir). The mixing resulted in biological water quality problems with odour, which raised concerns about the operational usage of the existing tunnel. .
.. the Leech River Tunnel ("Leech Tunnel", or just "Tunnel") and potential inter-basin transfer will be an interesting project to research, but it is beyond the scope of this thesis research. Before work is done on inter-basin transfers, the hydrology and water quality of the Leech River system needs to be better understood. The timing and magnitude of flows is important to accommodate the water license that the CRD holds for withdraws from the Leech (**winter withdraw**). Understanding source water quality is an essential part of managing water supply and a foundation of the multiple barrier approach to clear drinking water.       

Prior to purchase by the CRD, the LWSA was privately managed forest land. Approximately 96% of the Leech watershed was harvested (clear cut). The majority **(? % of total area ?)** of the LWSA forests are under 30 years of age. Now designated as a Water Supply Area, the Leech is managed by the CRD for source water protection, ecosystem services, and forest resilience. As forest fires pose a serious threat to monocultured and even-aged stands (**REFS**), particularly during the drought of summer, forest fuel management is a key preemptive risk reduction for the CRD. *** DID LEECH GET PCT & WAS IT PLANTED**
** precommercial thinning 5-10yrs after regen., versus 20 yrs, versus problem**

This thesis research is intended to bridge the objectives of the CRD and forWater: to better understand the hydrology and water quality of the LWSA, and to establish an understanding of "natural" variability across a forested source water area. The caveat on the term "natural" is to say that the majority (** HOW MANY **) of forested ecosystems on Vancouver Island are second growth forests which have previously been harvested. The forest industry is a crucial component of BC's economic system, and essential to the lives that people on the coast are accustomed to. (** facts about forestry in BC **). 
... gaining some understanding of water quality dynamics in a second growth forest will aid in understnading the relationship between forest management and drinking water treatability 

# Research Questions 

The research presented in this thesis focuses on describing the  spacial and temporal patterns and trends in water quality across the Leech River watershed, an area with a history of extensive forest harvest. The research questions addressed here are. 
	1. How do water quality and hydrologic response vary across the Leech Water Supply Area (what spatial patterns exist)?
	2. What are the temporal patterns in water quality changes, on a seasonal scale and within stormflow surges?
	3.  Is there a dominant signature from one of the mainstems at the future point of diversion (Leech Tunnel), and what are the treatment implications?

Research objectives, based on the above questions, were to: 
	* Monitor water quality and water level across the LWSA
	* Identify differences and similarities between sites (spatial) and variations over time (temporal, short and relatively long)
	* Relate findings to forest age and land-use history, versus sub-basin characteristics, and assess the implications for drinking water treatment
	
Tasks related to these research objectives were: site selection / method development / field installations / sample collection and analysis / data analysis and interpretation

# 	Research Sites & Methods

Spatial variability was studied by setting up parallel monitoring stations at six locations representing headwaters and three main stem rivers of the Leech River system. Temporal variability was addressed  in two ways: 1) at the seasonal scale: through a continuous  **15** month (** to Feb 2020) study; and (2) at the scale of stormflow: methods collected samples across stormflow surges.  

## Field Sites

Six sites were selected across the Leech Water Supply Area. The six research sites represent five nested catchments and the entire water supply area basin defined from the point of (future) diversion, the Leech Tunnel.

| Site Number | Site Name | Characteristic | Drainage Area (km^2) |    
|:------------|:----------|:---------------|:---------------------|
| 1   | Weeks Outlet  | Wetland-draining headwaters | 16 |
| 2   | Chris Creek | Headwaters | 9.6 |
| 3   | Leech River Head  | Mainstem river head | 26 |
| 4   | Cragg Creek | Mainstem river | 37 |
| 5   | West Leech River | Mainstem river | 35 |
| 6   | Leech River Tunnel| Future diversion point | 98 |

_Sites 1 and 2 monitor subcatchments of the site 3 drainage area._

__1. Weeks Outlet__
	Jordan Meadows wetland is located in the northwest of Leech River watershed. Jordan Meadows wetland drains to the east and joins the outflow of Weeks Lake (south end of the lake). The wetland and lake outflow streams join and flow east to Research Site #1 (Weeks Outlet), which is located west of the confluence with Chris Creek. The drainage basin associated with this Research Site is the western headwaters of Leech River.    
	The culvert is to be replaced in 2019 with a bridge, as it is perched above the streambed level and is obstructing the movement of fish and water flow. Downstream of the culvert are several small groundwater seeps which maintain low flow in the stagnant summer waters of this low-relief stream reach. The forest is dominated by western red cedar, hemlock, and Douglas fir. There are high levels of iron in the water downstream of the culvert, possibly due to rust.

## Sampling Methods

To address rapid temporal variability, the variability of water quality within stormflow surges, vertical rack sampling methods were employed in addition to standard grab sampling methods. Sampling began in earnest in October 2018, with stormflow samples collected until April 2019. Grab samples were collected at least monthly from October 2018 to ### February 2020 ####.      

### Vertical Rack Sampling

At each of the six research sites, a vertical sampling rack was installed. Each rack included a central stilling well (1.5" PCV conduit with 1/2" holes drilled along the length to allow the water level inside to equal the water level outside) with measuring tape affixed to the front, inside the stilling well was an [Odyssey Capacitance water level logger](http://odysseydatarecording.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=50), and on either side of the central stilling well was a slotted offset angle bar onto which siphon sampler bottles were held with hose clamps.  

Each sample bottle was set with a siphon lid which was based on a USGS single-stage sediment sampler design (US U-59, 1961). A siphon lid was composed of two sections of 1/4" (OD) aluminum tube, each with a 180 degree bend (like a candy cane). The tubes were different lengths, with the shorter tube acting as a water inlet and the taller tube acting as an air vent. A sample bottle set with siphon lid on a vertical rack functioned as a passive sampling device to collect a discrete water sample as the river rose around it. So long as the vent remained unobstructed, a bottle filled when the rising water level reached or surpassed the height of the inlet crown (the top of the inlet tube bend). When fully submerged, an air lock was created by a bubble trapped in the bend at the top of the vent tube, which prevented exchange between the water contained in the sample bottle and that of the river around it.  
Sample bottles could be set at any height interval, and were generally staggered at approximately 10-15cm intervals. Each time a bottle was placed on or removed from a vertical rack, the height of the inlet crown relative to the stilling well measuring tape was recorded; this "filling stage" was referenced to the river stage recorded inside the stilling well (Odyssey) and the corresponding date and time of sample collection was retrieved.  

Vertical rack sampling has several benefits, including: low cost (about $500 CND per installation, all in), low power (two 1/2-AA batteries in each logger), self-contained logger (no external power source or accessory equipment required), site-customizable design, passive sampling (no pumps).  The main drawback of the vertical rack method was that it only collected water samples on the rising limb of the hydrograph, and falling limb water samples had to be collected manually. Manual sample collection is a tried and true way to collect water quality data; however, sample collection can be limited by the time it takes to access multiple sample site, as well as environmental conditions (inclement weather, flood conditions, etc.) which may impede sampling efficiency or prevent sample collection entirely.  

Based on the principles of the rising-limb siphon sampling bottle, a falling-limb sampler prototype was created; following laboratory tests, the fifth iteration of this prototype was field-deployed in the LWSA.  

 #### Falling-limb Sampler Design
 
 The falling-limb siphon sampler prototype was based on the principle that air must be displaced from a sample bottle in order to fill with sample water; for example, the rising-limb siphon sampler could not collect a sample if the air vent was obstructed. Like the rising-limb siphon sampler the falling-limb siphon sampling lid had a water inlet tube made of 1/4" (OD) aluminum tube with a 180 degree bend; the key difference between the rising and falling limb samplers was the air vent. While the rising-limb sampler required only that the air vent was unobstructed for a sample to be collected when the river rose to the height of the inlet crown; the falling limb sampler required that the sample bottle remained empty until the river water level started to recede. To collect a sample of water on the falling-limb of the hydrograph, the siphon lid vent needed to remain closed until the water level dropped. Through multiple iterations, the falling-limb sampler prototype employed a variety of seals and plugs on the vent orifice, each of which was triggered to open by the weight of water as the river level dropped. The principle for each prototype remained the same: the vent  terminated in a secondary stilling well and was sealed with a plug of some type which was attached to a cup. The secondary stilling well (4" PVC pipe with 1/2" holes drilled along the length of it) filled with water at the river rose, as did the central cup attached to the vent plug. While the river level was higher than the cup brim, the vent remained sealed. And when the river level dropped, the full cup of water also dropped and the weight of water in the cup pulled the vent plug, opening the vent orifice and allowing air to escape the sample bottle for a water sample to be collected. Prototype vent closures included a bung that fit the inner diameter of the vent orifice, or a plug which fit the outer vent diameter. The main issue with prototype plugs was inconsistent release due to imprecise seal on the vent orifice (e.g insert the bung too far and it may not release, insert or cap too loosely and air leaks result in premature sample collection). 
SO AND SO ET AL employed the same principles of water-weight vent-release to collect falling-limb samples, and they used a ##gas ball valve##  and reported challenges with the valve getting stuck or the weight of water not being great enough to overcome the resistance of turning the valve.
The most recent, and field deployed, iteration of the falling-limb siphon sampler design used a silicone bite valve (CamelBack(TM)) to seal the vent orifice. The bite valve self-seals when no force is applied and opens when compressed. The current falling-limb siphon sampler design (FaLiSSa) was deployed on vertical racks and included a sample bottle fit with a FaLiSSa lid and accompanying "filling well". The lids each had two sections of 1/4" (OD) aluminum tube, the shorter water inlet tube had a 180 degree bend (like a candy cane), while the longer vent tube extended straight out of the lid and met with flexible tubing (1/4" ID, ##3/8" OD????) that made a 360 degree bend (a loop) before entering the filling well (4" PVC pipe stilling well) and terminating with a silicone bite-valve (vent-valve). Each filling well had a top cap to prevent infill from precipitation, and a grate insert which acted both as a horizontal cross beam for the vent-valve to rest on and as a guide to keep the trigger of the water-weight cup in line with the valve. The trigger was a 1" hose clamp, looped through the grate slots and over the vent-valve; when the water-weight cup was empty, the mass of the cup and hose clamp trigger was inadequate to compress and open the vent-valve. During stormflow surges, river water would rise around a vertical rack, consecutively filling rising-limb sample bottles that were set within the range of that stormflow surge. A FaLiSSa water-weight cup would fill when the river level exceeded the cup brim, and would trigger sample collection when the river level dropped below #______________#.....

#### Sampling Method Assumptions
 The vertical rack sampling methods used in this research assume that the river water column was well mixed (no stratification) so that the near-surface water was representative of the total river conditions at the sampling site at the time of sampling. In each of the six study locations in the LWSA, vertical racks were installed downstream of turbulent sloped sections, where river water was well-mixed. Another assumption is that siphon sampling bottles collect a discrete water sample and there was no exchange with surrounding air following sample collection. The assumption of discrete sampling was verified experimentally by submerging a siphon sampling bottle in a flow-through bucket containing clear colourless water; a sample was collected and then coloured dye was added and circulated around the full sample bottle for approximately twenty minutes before removing the sample bottle.  The contents of the bucket were compared to the contents of the sample bottle to reveal the the coloured water did not infiltrate siphon sampler and mix with the colourless original sample. While some vertical rack samples may remain submerged longer than 20 minutes, this proof of concept experiment satisfied the researcher's doubts of discrete sampling. The third and important assumption is that samples on the racks remain representative of river conditions until collected and analyzed. ...

 ### Supplemental Data

#### Temperature
In August of 2019, two Hobo TidbiT (Onset Data Logging) temperature sensors were added to each vertical rack installation, one monitoring air temperature (at the top of the rack) and the other monitoring water temperature (near the base of the rack).

#### Aqueous Metals
From November 2018 to June 2019, water samples were collected at each of the six reasearch sites on behalf of the CRD's Water Quality division for analysis of total metals at Maxxam Analytics Lab. 


## Analytical Methods

Water quality encompasses a wide and diverse range of dynamic chemical, biological, and physical parameters. In the case of this research, it was not possible to measure all water quality parameters, only a handful were feasible within this project's scope and resources. When water-quality is discussed in this thesis work, only the following parameters may be included:
*DOC
*TOC
*turbidity
*temperature
*nitrate (nitrogen as nitrate)
*total metals
