# general overview / forWater scope
The NSERC Strategic Network, forWater, is a transdisciplinary cross-Canada applied research collaboration focused on the connections between treated drinking water quality and land-use impacts of forest management. The majority of source drinking water originates in forested headwaters, but the connection between upstream forest management and downstream treatment remains poorly understood. forWater researchers are studying water quality in watersheds across Canada, under a variety of different forest management strategies. Through collaborative analyses, forWater is working to evaluate source water treatability metrics, downstream propagation effects, and resource economic *** with the ultimate goal of providing a framework for treatement demands???***

The Capital Regional District is committed to the multiple barrier approach to clean drinking water, and has taken control of source water protection by purchasing and privatizing the water supply areas for Greater Victoria. In 2007 and 2010, a large portion of the Leech River watershed was purchased from private timber company, and that 96km2 is now protected and designated as a future supplemental water supply area: the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA).     

# objective
As a member of the Watershed Science and Forest Management Theme of forWater, I am working in partnership with the CRD to contribute to their ongoing pursuit of characterizing the LWSA. 
The objective of my master's research project is to establish a baseline understanding of hydrologic responses and water quality variabilty in rivers across the LWSA. The approach includes advanced synoptic sampling within stormflow, supplemented with standard grab samples between storm events and during summer baseflow. Discrete samples of river water were collected passively during the rising limb of stormflow (falling limb prototype in progress) using low-powered, low-cost, custom-built vertical rack samplers including water level loggers (Odyssey) and reference staff gauges. By collecting samples during stormflow, a more robust understanding of water quality dynamics is achievable. Using low-powered passive sampling techniques allowed for multiple (six) sites to be equipped with monitoring/sampling racks, providing fairly good spatial resolution of hydrochemical variability across the watershed.
