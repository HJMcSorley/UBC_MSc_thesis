MSc Research Design and Planning

Background research
	reading papers about DBP, land-use, OC
	
Focus on:	
	Dimensions of disturbance + cumulative effects
		How long ago did harvest occur (new, regenerating, re-established)?
		What type of silviculture is involved / management strategy?
	Hydrologic regimes: Rainfall and snowmelt events in harvested and unharvested areas
Consider
	- 12 campaigns that could be representative of each combination of hydrologic regime and disturbance dimension
	- evaluation of flowpaths related to DOM composition (possible modeling framework)
	
Partnerships
		CRD - Leech water supply area
			little is known about the area
			compare and contrast OC concentration and character from ten sites 
				sites are in agreement with Hydrological Monitoring locations (planned)
			watershed boundaries with each site a POI
				disturbance characteristics (age of forest, type of previous harvest)
				
		CVRD - Comox Lake Water Supply
			collection of 10 samples from regularly monitored tributaries
			
Identify Issues:
	little is known about the Leech - Future water supply area
	there may be issued with combining Leech and Sooke water (Mazumder bio mixing experiments)
	certain times of year may pose more of a risk
	will treatability dynamics change?

Data Collection and Analysis:
	Biophysical Factors
		geology
		surficial materials
		soils
		stream network
		topography
		wetlands
	Landuse
		foresty management	
			harvest history
			stand structure
			fire control
			
Synthesis:
	spatial and temporal variation
	consider all aspects of the system to provide a comprehensive assessment
		what is constant over time?
		what changes over time?
		what is constant over space (if anything)?
		what changed over space?
