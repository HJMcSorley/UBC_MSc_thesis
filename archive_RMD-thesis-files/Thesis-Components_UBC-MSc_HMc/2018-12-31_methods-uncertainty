Rising level siphon samplers collect water from approximately 5cm below the surface (top of intake tube to inlet orifice) 
assumptions: 
	- the water column is well mixed (no vertical stratification)
	- because the water column is well mixed the sample is representative of the stream content at the time associated with that level (match to Odyssey)
	
	
Errors of calibration on Odyssey Level Loggers:
+/- 1cm for sharpie mark widths	
+/- 1cm for paralax in reading the meniscus at sensor mark
