# Sampling Methods
## Vertical racks for passive water sampling on the rising limb of hydrograph 
### Theory
### Design
### Benefits, challenges and assumptions
### Field protocol
### Method QA/QC: rising limb sampler quality assurance and quality control  
#### Assumption validation: rack samples are stable from collection to retrieval and analysis
##### Temperatures (above and below water on racks)
##### Hold-time experiments
#### Assumption validation: samples collected are discrete (no subsequent mixing) 
##### Rising limb sampler discretion analysis
## Development of a passive water sampler design for the falling limb of hydrograph (falling limb sampler)
### Theory
### Design 
### Benefits, challenges and assumptions
### Field protocol
### Method QA/QC: falling limb sampler quality assurance and quality control

# Results & Discussion 
## Spatial variability: DOC variability across the watershed 
### Synoptic grab sampling at ten locations
### Stormflow samples: compare and contrast six sites
## Temporal variability: DOC variability over time and within stormflow
### Seasonal patterns over sixteen months of data
### Stormflow samples: variability within six sites
