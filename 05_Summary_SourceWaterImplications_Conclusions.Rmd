### Introduction

This research was conducted to better understand spatial and temporal variations in source water quality across a second-growth forested watershed. Water quality dynamics were evaluated as the quantity and quality of natural organic matter (NOM), a master variable in aquatic systems. Three research questions and objectives were addressed in this thesis. The first research objective was to design a sampling strategy for evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns and variance in NOM quality and quantity across 12 sites in the Greater Victoria Water Supply Areas (Chapters 2 and 3). The second research objective was to identify which watershed characteristics and hydroclimatic conditions best explained the aqueous NOM dynamics observed through sampling (Chapter 4). This chapter speaks to the third research objective, of framing results in context of continued water quality monitoring and planning for drinking water supply and future inter-basin transfers in the Greater Victoria Water Supply Areas (GVWASA).

### Synopsis

Vertical Racks were used to passively sample the rising-limb of event hydrographs at six monitoring sites in the Leech WSA. Rack sampling was coupled with synoptic Grab sampling campaigns to measuring water quality changes over 16 months from October 2018 to February 2020. Aqueous natural organic matter (NOM) quantity was measured as the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and NOM quality was assessed by proxy using UV-Vis spectroscopic proxies. The molecular structure of NOM (i.e. it's quality) can vary from large, highly aromatic compounds to smaller aliphatic molecules and differences can be attributed to the source material. Terrestrial humic substances (i.e. allochthonous NOM) tends to be higher molecular weight, larger and more aromatic in structure; while in-stream sources of NOM (i.e. autochthonous NOM), such as algae, are typically more aliphatic in structure. The spectral absorbance coefficient at 254 nm (SAC~254~) was used as an indicator of NOM reactivity and the quotient of SAC~250~ to SAC~365~ (E~2~:E~3~) was used as an indicator of NOM molecular size and aromaticity [@Peuravuori1997; @Helms2008]. Results of these studies yielded six key findings which are provided below and discussed in the following sections. 

\  

### Key findings

Foundational results and method development (Chapter 2) elucidated two key findings: 

1. Vertical Rack stream water sample stability depended on the field conditions that samples were held under and the character of NOM contained in the sample: early wet season NOM was more aliphatic and less stable, mid- to late-season samples were stable up to 20 days at temperatures between 0-7° C, and freezing appeared to change NOM molecular attributes
2. SAC~254~ was a better indicator of disinfection byproduct formation potential (DBP-FP) than was DOC concentration or specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA~254~).

\  

Analyses of NOM quantity and quality over space and time clarified spatiotemporal patterns and drivers for NOM dynamics, which included these main findings:

3. In each season, DOC concentration was loosely correlated to air temperature, with higher concentrations occurring at warmer temperatures and lower concentrations occurring at lower temperatures 
4. There was a seasonal shift in NOM character, from predominantly aliphatic in the dry season to predominantly aromatic in the wet season. And despite differences in seasonal patterns, averages in DOC concentration were equal (6 ± 3 mg/L) in both wet and dry seasons
5. NOM quantity decreased from upstream to downstream in both seasons, as did NOM reactivity. However, while NOM molecular size and aromaticity decreased from low to high order streams in the wet season, the reverse was observed in the dry season
6. In the Leech WSA, streams draining the west of the watershed had higher DOC concentrations of more reactive and aromatic NOM compared to streams draining from the east; the western sites also had the least area harvested (1980-2011) of the six sub-basins. While Random Forest (RF) variable importance measure (VIM) identified forest age and harvest history as important predictor variables for NOM aromaticity and molecular size, RF VIM determined that subsurface parent material was a key driver for NOM quantity as well as quality. The west of Leech watershed has predominantly Leech River formation (metasedimentary) as parent material, while the east is predominant wark gneiss parent material (metamorphic).

### Implications for drinking water supply and watershed management

The quantity and quality of aqueous NOM varied over space and through time; understanding these patterns can help to inform source drinking water management decisions by providing insights to the origins, transport and fate of aqueous NOM and other parameters associated with it (e.g. metals, correlated DBPs). Treatability concerns could result from natural fluctuations in NOM character and concentrations across a water supply area and over time [@Levine2016]; @Li2014; @Yang2015). The molecular composition and physical structure of NOM influence its functionality and reactivity, therefore different types of aqueous NOM have different DBP-FPs and aquatic ecosystem roles [@Cory2011; @Delpla2016; @Yang2015; @HealthCanada2019a; @Chow2008]. As NOM is an aquatic master variable, site-specific knowledge of relationships between NOM quantity and quality with other water quality parameters or contaminants (e.g. metals, nutrients, algae blooms) could allow for extrapolation and anticipation of treatment challenges.

\  

Overall, DOC concentrations in the Leech WSA were higher than BC source water Guidelines suggest (4 mg/L). However, it should be noted that if Leech River water is transferred to a reservoir prior to treatment that NOM is likely to be photodegraded or diminished through microbial processing [@Kalbitz2000; @Stanley2012; @Aiken2011]. While it is important to understand the source, transport and fate of aqueous NOM (and its associated parameters) in the Leech WSA, the fluvial source water quality is unlikely to directly reflect the water at the intake tower due to reservoir residence times and the effects of photodegradation, physiochemical reactions and changes, biodegradation, transformation, or possibly bioproduction of NOM. Having a sound understanding of the timing and magnitude of NOM flux and anticipating temporal changed in NOM quality (especially reactivity) will provide valuable baseline information to feed into further water supply studies.   

\  

It will be informative to explore mixing studies between Leech River water with a balancing reservoir or other tributary in Sooke basin. The Leech River will introduce new material and new conditions (e.g. different temperatures, dissolved oxygen, carbonate for buffering or organic acids altering pH, new microbiota). As mixing is likely to change source water attributes, a balancing reservoir to stabilize between river and reservoir may be extremely useful. Future studies of Sooke Reservoir limnology and watershed water balance would be helpful to anticipate potential biogeochemical interactions and possible treatment challenges.

###	Concluding remarks

This research contributes to baseline understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of NOM quantity and quality across the GVWSA second growth forested watershed. These baseline data can be applied in further exploration of forest management strategies, such as fire fuel management, and impacts on source water quality and supply. For example, knowing that hydrologic connectivity to the terrestrial landscape increases throughout the wet season suggests that there may be a delay in measurable water quality changes following experimental forest treatments (e.g. prescribed burning, closed canopy fire break thinning, etc.) or natural disturbances (e.g. wasting events, wildfire). Therefore, hydrologic and water quality monitoring programs could be tailored to this consideration.  

\  

Further evaluation of water quality data with hydrometeorological variables could foster the establishment of operational risk indices that link to current monitoring programs (i.e. wildfire risk index). And coupling Vertical Rack sampling methods with hydrometric monitoring and rating curves would contribute to estimates of fluvial mass transport and loads (e.g. of contaminants). 

\  

Although this research was site-specific to the GVWSA, results -- including sampling strategies and spatial and temporal variation in water quality -- can be applied in other forested hydrology water quality studies that examine adjacent basins and nested catchments.
