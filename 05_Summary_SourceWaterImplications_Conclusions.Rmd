### Synopsis

Vertical Racks were used to passively sample the rising-limb of event hydrographs at six monitoring sites in the Leech WSA. Rack sampling was coupled with synoptic Grab sampling campaigns to measuring water quality changes over 16 months from October 2018 to February 2020. Aqueous natural organic matter (NOM) quantity was measured as the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and NOM quality was assessed by proxy using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The spectral absorbance coefficient at 254 nm (SAC~254~) was used as an indicator of NOM reactivity and the quotient of SAC~250~ to SAC~365~ (E~2~:E~3~) was used as an indicator of NOM molecular size and aromaticity [@Peuravuori1997; @Helms2008]. Results of these studies yielded six key findings which are provided below and discussed in the following sections. 

\  

### Key findings

Foundational results and method development (Chapter 2) elucidated two key findings: 

1. Vertical Rack stream water sample stability depended on the field conditions that samples were held under and the character of the NOM contained in the sample,
2. SAC~254~ was a better indicator of disinfection byproduct formation potential (DBP-FP) than was DOC concentration or specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA~254~).

\  

Analyses of NOM quantity and quality over space and time clarified spatiotemporal patterns and drivers for NOM dynamics, which included these main findings:

3. In each season, DOC concentration was loosely correlated to air temperature, with higher concentrations occurring at warmer temperatures and lower concentrations occurring at lower temperatures. And despite differences in seasonal patterns, seasonal averages in DOC concentration were approximately equal (6 ± 3 mg/L), 
4. There was a seasonal shift in NOM character, from predominantly aliphatic in the dry season to predominantly aromatic in the wet season, 
5. NOM quantity decreased from upstream to downstream in both seasons, as did NOM reactivity. However, while NOM molecular size and aromaticity decreased from low to high order streams in the wet season, the reverse was observed in the dry season, 
6. In the Leech WSA, streams draining the west of the watershed had higher DOC concentrations of more reactive and aromatic NOM compared to streams draining from the east, and Random Forest (RF) variable importance measure (VIM) determined that subsurface parent material was a key driver for NOM quantity and quality (the west of Leech watershed has Leech River formation (metagreywacke) as a dominant parent material, and the east is predominant wark gneiss).  

\  

#### Rack sample stability

A challenge of Vertical Rack sampling is that high water can prohibit safe retrieval of collected samples from the Racks. By coupling continuously recorded stage with manually recorded siphon-bottle heights sample hold-times were calculated for quality assurance of samples that had exceeded an acceptable holding time. 

\  

Aqueous NOM in early wet-season samples was unstable with respect to concentration and should be analyzed in less than seven days following collection. These results are in line with work by Fellman et al. [-@Fellman2008]. Later wet-season samples were stable on the vertical Rack for up to 20 days at temperatures between 0° C and 7° C. Stream water samples left on the Vertical Rack for extended periods (>34 days) lead to changes in NOM character and greater variability in DOC concentrations among replicate samples. Additional experiments could be conducted to determine if the main factor for changes in NOM in these extended-hold samples were mainly due to the hold-time or to the effects of freezing. Freezing has been shown to decrease sample DOC concentrations in laboratory experiments [@Fellman2008]. 

\    

#### NOM as a master variable

The quantity and quality of aqueous NOM varied over space and through time; understanding these patterns can help to inform source drinking water management decisions by providing insights to the origins, transport and fate of aqueous NOM and other parameters associated with it. For example, NOM can bind and transport metals in solution [@LaZerte1991; @Aiken2011] and in the Leech WSA, DOC was positively correlated (Appendix E2) to the concentrations of total mercury (r=0.9999), iron (r=0.83), manganese (r=0.77), and aluminum (r=0.63) as well as (to a lesser degree) barium (r=0.47), copper (0.42), and arsenic (r=0.33). 

\  

Additionally, NOM in drinking source water supply is partially responsible for the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in treated drinking water [@Yang2015; @Chow2008; @Beauchamp2018]. As a predictor of DBP-FPs, SAC~254~ was better correlated (r=0.68; Appendix E1) than SUVA~254~ or DOC concentration. 

\  

Because NOM is tied to transport of contaminants and drinking water treatment challenges, understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of this master variable is important for maintaining drinking water security and mitigating treatment challenges. 

\  

### Spatiotemporal patterns in NOM quantity and quality

While the average quantity of NOM was the same between seasons (6 ± 3 mg/L DOC), the quality of NOM differed. Aqueous NOM was larger, more aromatic and more reactive during the wet seasons than during the dry season. More aromatic NOM in the wet season was likely sourced from autochthonous terrestrial sources (e.g. humic and fluvic acids), while the less aromatic dry season NOM was probably made up of autochthonous NOM from in-stream processes (e.g. algae). The seasonal shift in NOM quality from autochthonous to allochthonous material was predicted by the river continuum concept (RCC, e.g. @Vannote1980, @Mosher2015]. The RCC explains temporal changes in NOM character through variable mobilization of source material and biogeochemical processing.

\  

Aside from Weeks crk, which maintained highly aromatic NOM throughout the year due to proximity to the wetlands of Weeks Lake, the Leech WSA sub-basin sites showed longitudinal decrease in NOM quantity. In both wet and dry seasons, DOC concentrations decreased from low to higher order streams, but NOM molecular quality had opposite longitudinal patterns in each season. From low to high order streams, there was an increase in aromaticity and molecular size (indicated by E~2~:E~3~) during the dry season and a decrease in the wet season. The wet season decrease in NOM aromaticity was expected to occur in tandem with the longitudinal decrease in DOC concentration, due to dilution effects along stream reaches. In contrast, it was not expected that higher order streams would have larger and more aromatic NOM than lower order streams during the dry season, especially when DOC concentrations showed the opposite pattern. It was expected that NOM aromaticity would decrease with downstream transport at low flows, due to abiotic and/or biotic oxidation such as photodegradation and/or heterotrophic processing or adsorption [@Creed2015; @Kalbitz2000]. 

\ 

It was possible that UV-Vis interference caused the observed NOM quality pattern -- like chromophoric NOM (the target analyte), other dissolved inorganic species (e.g. iron, nitrate, nitrite, bromide) also absorb light at wavelengths around 254 nm [@StdMet5910]. Concentrations of iron and nitrogen species were not measured, therefore their interference cannot be confirmed; however, the full scan absorption spectra (not shown) displayed gradual decrease in absorbance with increasing wavelength with no major spikes, suggesting few interferences. Therefore, the patterns in spectral indicies were believed to be unbiased indication of greater NOM aromaticity at lower reaches in the dry months. 

\  

The relative elevation in downstream NOM aromaticity and molecular size during the dry season could indicate that more easily altered (i.e. labile) NOM was removed (via biotic or abiotic factors) and larger, more aromatic and recalcitrant NOM was transported downstream resulting in a longitudinal concentration in the dry season. Or, the more aromatic NOM character at lower reaches could have been due to humic inputs from NOM-rich tributaries feeding higher order streams, or perhaps in-stream microbial processing of terrestrial organic matter (e.g. leaf litter) generated aqueous humic solutes.    

\  

In the wet season, when hydrologic connectivity was greatest, the West Leech sub-basin had aromaticity and molecular size comparable to that of the wetland and lake-dominated Weeks crk sub-basin; though in the dry season, Weeks crk maintained highly aromatic character of stream NOM while the other sub-basins had lower molecular wight, less aromatic NOM than was found at the Tunnel site. 

\  

Early in the wet season there was a decrease in NOM quantity with increasing flows (higher stage), and as the wet season progresses, stream NOM quantity and aromaticity increased with increasing flows. These findings were in line with the pulse-shunt concept (PSC, @Raymond2016, @Aguilera2018). In the Leech WSA monitoring sites, the most aromatic and highest molecular weight NOM samples were collected late in the wet season. 

\  

In the Leech WSA, streams draining the west of the watershed had higher DOC concentrations of more reactive and aromatic NOM compared to streams draining from the east. A key difference between the two sides of the watershed is dominant parent material, where basins predominantly underlain by wark gneiss had lower DOC concentrations and those underlain by the Leech River formation (metagreywacke) had higher DOC concentrations. Random Forest (RF) variable importance measure (VIM) determined that subsurface parent material was a key driver for NOM quantity and quality.  

\  

In the Leech WSA, sub-basins draining the west had the highest aqueous NOM quantity with the greatest aromaticity, reactivity and molecular size. Lower levels of NOM with smaller, less aromatic and less reactive quality were found in basins draining from the east of the Leech WSA. As anticipated by the river continuum concept and the pulse-shunt concept [@Vannote1980; @Raymond2016], spatial variation in Leech WSA fluvial NOM was attributed to hydrological processes and watershed characteristics. The most important watershed characteristics for NOM dynamics in the Leech WSA were geomorphic parent material. Stream stage was the key hydrologic condition for predicting NOM quantity, and antecedent wetness was key for predicting NOM quality. 

\  

#### Drivers for variation

Data from six sub-basin stream monitoring sites in the Leech WSA were used to assess sampling conditions and watershed characteristic variable importance for predicting NOM concentration and character.   

* Aqueous NOM dynamics were largely driven by warm and wet conditions across the Leech WSA. 
* wetness connecting 
* Watershed characteristics, such as sub-basin parent materials and forest structure (age and logging history) are likely responsible for some spatial variation in stream water quality. In conjunction with physical characteristics of the watershed, hydrologic conditions are primarily responsible for temporal variations observeds in stream water quality. 
* Although sampling stage was directly related to rain conditions, in that more rain generated greater stream rise, rain was relatively more important as a predictor for DOC concentration than sampling stage was... this indicates that it may not have been the stage at which samples were collected, but rather at the antecedent wetness conditions (if you consider rain a proxy for wetness, which seems reasonable). 
* this indicates that greater saturation, which may be indicative of the connectivity between streams and the terrestrial environment, was more important than precipitation inputs in general.

... It appeared that when streams were near 75% of their maximum stage (therefore, approximately 0.75 of peak flow) humic source pools reached maximum connectivity with the streams... this could be explained by...
* the apparent stage threshold for peak DOC (~0.75 of max sampling stage) suggests a point at which allochthonous (humic) NOM supply reached maximum connectivity with the streams. This threshold could also indicate a point at with the event hydrograph was separated from soil water contributions and throughflow to overland flow and throughfall [@Penna2019]. 



, physical impoundments, organic matter inputs and sources, mass transport, solar inputs, and processing by aquatic invertebrates and microbes [@Stanley2012; @Aiken2011; @Zarnetske2018]. 

* The NOM quality changes that occurred seasonally are a strong indicator that site-specific calibrations should be performed at least a few times a year if DOC/NOM is monitoried by UV-Vis *in-situ*. DOC concentrations were typically higher than BC source water Guidelines suggest, however it should be noted that if Leech River water is transferred to a reservoir prior to treatment that NOM is likely to be photodegraded or diminished through microbial processing.



### Discussion and implications for drinking water supply and watershed management

Research Question 3. What are the implications for watershed management and future drinking water supply?


--> Provide context of how results can be used to inform watershed management planning for wildfire reduction strategies and design of continued water quality monitoring for future inter-basin transfers.

* Although DOC exceeded source water guidelines for TOC (4 mg/L), ... RESERVOIR EFFECTS
* establishing connectivity among nested catchments as a baseline for experimental treatments (future)
* conflicting objectives and competing values (Peter Duinker's work)
  * managing temperate forests for timber removes carbon pools, managing for protection may increase the carbon, thus protection does not necessarily improve water quality. 
  * timber / carbon sequestration / water / biodiversity
* source water quality in rivers is unlikely to reflect the water at the intake tower
  * reservoir residence times
  * photodegradation
  * physiochemcial reactions and changes
  * biodegradation // transformation // bioproduction of NOM
  * the rivers introduce new material and new conditions (e.g. different temperatures, dissolved oxygen, carbonate for buffering or organic acids altering pH, new microbiota) the 
  * mixing is likely to change river source water -- a blanacing reservoir to stabilize between river and reservoir may be extremely useful (like how you add a bit of new water at a time for a goldfish in a bowl, to allow equilibration)
  * UV degradation is likely in lakes
  * while river water quality will not identify source water quality (pre-treatment) it is important to know IN TANDEM with Sooke Res limnology to anticipate potnetial problems based on conditions in each & knowledge of likely or possible interactions
  
 
  
###	Concluding remarks

Across the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA), the timing of changes in temperature, river response and DOC concentrations and character were synchronized in the five nested catchments and Leech River Tunnel site (future point of diversion, or mouth of the WSA), however the mean values and magnitude of these changes differed between sites. 


Q) Across the LWSA, was the variance in DOC greater within each site or among all sites?

Q) Was the variance in DOC greater at the watershed outlet than the variance in each subbasin?
