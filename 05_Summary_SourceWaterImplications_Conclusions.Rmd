This project characterized aqueous NOM concentration and character ranges across the Greater Victoria Water Supply Area (GVWSA) over sixteen months and explored relationships between watershed variables and sample results across the Leech WSA. Chapters two and three tackled the first research question, which focused on method refinement for measuring variability of aqueous NOM. Spatiotemporal NOM data were collected through (1) six sub-basin sites equipped with vertical racks which logged river stage, air and water temperature at 10-minute intervals, and passively collected whole water samples during stormflow on rising limbs of the hydrograph; and (2) twelve sites, including the six sub-basin sites, were sampled synoptically every two to four weeks. 

\  

Results from twelve sites across the GVWSA were used to assess broad spatial and temporal patterns in stream NOM dynamics (Chapter 3). More in-depth analyses were completed for six of those sites which were equipped with vertical sampling racks (Chapter 4). Relationships between sample results and watershed characteristics and sampling conditions were evaluated to identify drivers for changes in NOM concentration and character across the Leech WSA (~96 km^2^) and its nested catchments (ranging in size from 9.6 to 37 km^2^). 

\  

### Recap and synopsis of results

Vertical Racks for passive event rising limb event hydrograph sampling were coupled with synoptic Grab sampling campaigns to measuring water quality changes over 16 months from October 2018 to February 2020. A challenge of Vertical Rack sampling is that high water can prohibit safe retrieval of collected samples from the Racks. Coupling continuously recorded stage with manually recorded siphon bottle heights allowed for calculation of sample hold-times and quality control measures for samples that had exceeded an acceptable holding time (Chapter 2). Hold-time experiments showed that aqueous NOM in early wet-season samples was unstable with respect to concentration, and should be analyzed in less than seven days following collection. Later wet-season samples were stable on the vertical Rack for up to 20 days at temperatures between 0° C and 7° C. Samples held on the vertical Rack for 34 days showed changes to NOM quality and greater variability in concentration. Further evaluation and replicate experiments would clarify the effects of sample freezing on vertical racks, which has been shown to decrease sample DOC concentrations in laboratory experiments [@Fellman2008].

\    

Quantities and qualities of NOM vary over space and through time; understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of concentrations and character can help to inform source drinking water management decisions by providing insights to the origins, transport and fate of aqueous NOM and other parameters associated with it. For example, NOM can bind and transport metals in solution [@LaZerte1991; @Aiken2011] and In the Leech WSA, DOC was positively correlated (Appendix XXXX) to the concentrations of total mercury (r=0.9999), iron (r=0.83), manganese (r=0.77), and aluminum (r=0.63) as well as (to a lesser degree) barium (r=0.47), copper (0.42), and arsenic (r=0.33). Additionally, NOM in drinking source water supply is partially responsible for the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in treated drinking water (Appendix NNNNN; @Yang2015; @Chow2008; @Beauchamp2018).  SAC~254~ was better correlated (r=0.68; Appendix VVVVVV) to DBP-FP than SUVA~254~ or DOC concentration, and was used as an indicator of NOM reactivity. 

\  

Because NOM is tied to transport of contaminants and drinking water treatment challenges, understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of this master variable is important for maintaining drinking water security and mitigating treatment challenges.

#### Spatiotemporal dynamics in the quantity and quality of NOM

The sampling period spanned sixteen months, from October 2018 to February 2020. Seasons were defined as 'wet' and 'dry' and were distinguished by the activity of passive Vertical Rack sample collection. The wet season was characterized by conditions that generated event responses which triggered rising-stage sample collection in the six Leech WSA monitoring site streams (Chapter 2). Based on this definition of seasons, Vertical Racks collected rising limb samples only in the wet season (fall/winter/spring) while Grab samples were collected throughout the entire sampling period. During events, Grab samples were collected prior to stream rise, on the falling limb or between events, but not on the rising limb (not by design, but by happenstance). Sampling began after the start of the 2018/2019 wet season, which extended until mid-May 2019. The dry season spanned from mid-May to late September 2019, the start of the 2019/2020 wet season. 

\  

Results showed spatial patterns that were predicted by the river continuum concept (RCC), including higher levels of NOM in headwaters with attenuation in quantity along stream reaches. Longitudinal reduction in DOC (decreasing concentrations from upstream to downstream) were observed across the GVWSA sampling sites.

In the Leech WSA, sub-basins draining the west had the highest aqueous NOM quantity with the greatest aromaticity, reactivity and molecular size. Lower levels of NOM with smaller, less aromatic and less reactive quality were found in basins draining from the east of the Leech WSA. As anticipated by the river continuum concept and the pulse-shunt concept [@Vannote1980; @Raymond2016], spatial variation in Leech WSA fluvial NOM was attributed to hydrological processes and watershed characteristics. The most important watershed characteristics for NOM dynamics in the Leech WSA were geomorphic parent material. Stream stage was the key hydrologic condition for predicting NOM quantity, and antecedent wetness was key for predicting NOM quality. 

, physical impoundments, organic matter inputs and sources, mass transport, solar inputs, and processing by aquatic invertebrates and microbes [@Stanley2012; @Aiken2011; @Zarnetske2018]. 

* The NOM quality changes that occurred seasonally are a strong indicator that site-specific calibrations should be performed at least a few times a year if DOC/NOM is monitoried by UV-Vis *in-situ*. DOC concentrations were typically higher than BC source water Guidelines suggest, however it should be noted that if Leech River water is transferred to a reservoir prior to treatment that NOM is likely to be photodegraded or diminished through microbial processing.


While the average quantity of NOM was the same between seasons (6 ± 3 mg/L DOC), the quality of NOM differed. Aqueous NOM was larger, more aromatic and more reactive during the wet seasons than during the dry season; this seasonal character shift from autochthonous to allochthonous source quality was also predicted by the RCC.

\  

Spatially, in both wet and dry seasons, DOC concentrations decreased from low to higher order streams, but NOM quality had opposite longitudinal patterns in each season. From low to high order streams, there was an increase in aromaticity and molecular size (indicated by E~2~:E~3~) during the dry season and a decrease in the wet season. The wet season decrease in NOM aromaticity was expected to occur in tandem with the longitudinal decrease in DOC concentration, due to dilution effects along stream reaches. In contrast, it was not expected that higher order streams would have larger and more aromatic NOM than lower order streams during the dry season, especially when DOC concentrations showed the opposite pattern. During downstream transport at low flows, is was expected that NOM would decrease in aromaticity due to abiotic or biotic oxidation (e.g. photodegradation and/or heterotrophic processing). 

It is possible that the simultaneous increase in absorbance and decrease in organic carbon 

\ 

The relative elevation in downstream NOM aromaticity and molecular size (higher SAC~254~ and lower E~2~:E~3~) during the dry season could be due to UV-Vis interference: like chromophoric NOM (the target analyte), other dissolved inorganic species (e.g. iron, nitrate, nitrite, bromide) also absorb light at wavelengths around 254 nm [@StdMet5910]. Concentrations of iron and nitrogen species were not measured, therefore their interference cannot be confirmed; however, the full scan absorption spectra (not shown here) displayed gradual decrease in absorbance with increasing wavelength with no major spikes, suggesting few interferences. Therefore, it seems more likely that the spectral indicies were indeed indicative of greater NOM aromaticity at lower reaches in the dry months, and were not due to aqueous species interference.  

\  

More aromatic NOM at lower reaches could have been due to humic inputs from NOM-rich tributaries feeding higher order streams, or perhaps in-stream microbial processing of terrestrial organic matter (e.g. leaf litter) generated aqueous humic solutes.    

\  

More aromatic NOM in the wet season was likely sources from autochthonous terrestrial sources (e.g., humic and fluvic acids), while the less aromatic dry season NOM . it's quite possibly that the increase in summer DOC was due to autochthonous sources such as algae and cyanobacteria, while fall DOC was

* The site with the second highest DOC range was the West Leech sub-basin (20.85 km2) with mean DOC of 5.8 ± 2.4 mg/L (41% RSD).



## temporal stuff
* Based on spectroscopic indications that dry season NOM was less aromatic in character, it's quite possibly that the increase in summer DOC was due to autochthonous sources such as algae and cyanobacteria, while fall DOC was likely sources from autochthonous terrestrial sources (e.g., humic and fluvic acids).
* Mean DOC was the same, on average, in the wet and dry seasons (6 ± 3 mg/L). 
* seasonal shift from autochthonous NOM sources in the dry season to allochthonous NOM sources in the wet season
* In the wet season, when hydrologic connectivity was greatest, the West Leech sub-basin had aromaticity and molecular size comparable to that of the wetland and lake-dominated Weeks crk sub-basin; though in the dry season, Weeks crk maintained highly aromatic character of stream NOM while the other sub-basins had lower molecular wight, less aromatic NOM than was found at the Tunnel site. The dry season spatial pattern of NOM quality was not expected. Based on the RCC, it was expected that there would be a spatial reduction in NOM character from headwaters to mouth. However, in the dry season, samples collected at the highest order stream (at the future point of diversion) were more aromatic in NOM character than all of the nested catchments except for Weeks crk, which maintained highly aromatic NOM throughout the year due to proximity to the wetlands of Weeks Lake.  
* storm responses: early in the wet season there was a decrease in NOM concentration with increasing flows (higher stage), and as the wet season progresses, stream NOM concentration and aromaticity increased with increasing flows.

predicts a temporal shift in NOM character from autochthonous (e.g. algal) to allochthonous (e.g. humic material) sources, and a spatial reduction in NOM molecular diversity from headwaters to river mouth. 
* Mean DOC among the six sites was essentially the same in both the wet and dry seasons (Chapter 3), but spatial patterns differed between the seasons. In the dry season, aqueous NOM aromaticity increased from upstream to downstream monitoring sites; while the wet season showed effects of dilution on both the quantity and quality of NOM. These seasonal differences support both a shift in NOM source material and a shift from NOM processing in the dry season and transport/dilution effects in the wet season.




##### Drivers for variation

Data from six sub-basin stream monitoring sites in the Leech WSA were used to assess sampling conditions and watershed characteristic variable importance for predicting NOM concentration and character.   

* Aqueous NOM dynamics were largely driven by warm and wet conditions across the Leech WSA. 
* wetness connecting 
* Watershed characteristics, such as sub-basin parent materials and forest structure (age and logging history) are likely responsible for some spatial variation in stream water quality. In conjunction with physical characteristics of the watershed, hydrologic conditions are primarily responsible for temporal variations observeds in stream water quality. 
* Although sampling stage was directly related to rain conditions, in that more rain generated greater stream rise, rain was relatively more important as a predictor for DOC concentration than sampling stage was... this indicates that it may not have been the stage at which samples were collected, but rather at the antecedent wetness conditions (if you consider rain a proxy for wetness, which seems reasonable). 
* this indicates that greater saturation, which may be indicative of the connectivity between streams and the terrestrial environment, was more important than precipitation inputs in general.

... It appeared that when streams were near 75% of their maximum stage (therefore, approximately 0.75 of peak flow) humic source pools reached maximum connectivity with the streams... this could be explained by...
* the apparent stage threshold for peak DOC (~0.75 of max sampling stage) suggests a point at which allochthonous (humic) NOM supply reached maximum connectivity with the streams. This threshold could also indicate a point at with the event hydrograph was separated from soil water contributions and throughflow to overland flow and throughfall [@Penna2019].

#### Caveats and limitations

It was assumed that the UV-Vis spectral absorbances for each stream water sample were due to the natural organic matter content, however it is possible that other water quality variables could cause interference. For example, dissolved or colloidal nitrate, nitrite and iron species can absorb light at 250 nm, 254 nm or 365 nm, the wavelengths common to NOM absorption [@StdMet5910].

###	Concluding remarks



Across the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA), the timing of changes in temperature, river response and DOC concentrations and character were synchronized in the five nested catchments and Leech River Tunnel site (future point of diversion, or mouth of the WSA), however the mean values and magnitude of these changes differed between sites. 


Q) Across the LWSA, was the variance in DOC greater within each site or among all sites?

Q) Was the variance in DOC greater at the watershed outlet than the variance in each subbasin?
