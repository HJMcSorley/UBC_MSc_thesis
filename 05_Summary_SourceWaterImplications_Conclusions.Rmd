### Discussion of results in context of drinking water supply

Mean DOC among the six sites was essentially the same in both the wet and dry seasons (Chapter 3), but spatial patterns differed between the seasons. In the dry season, aqueous NOM aromaticity increased from upstream to downstream monitoring sites; while the wet season showed effects of dilution on both the quantity and quality of NOM. These seasonal differences support both a shift in NOM source material and a shift from NOM processing in the dry season and transport/dilution effects in the wet season.

\  

What are the implications for watershed management and future drinking water supply?

Provide context of how results can be used to inform watershed management planning for wildfire reduction strategies and design of continued water quality monitoring for future inter-basin transfers.

Longitudinal attenuation in DOC (decreasing concentrations from upstream to downstream) and SAC~254~ were observed across the sampling sites as was a seasonal shift from autochthonous NOM sources in the dry season to allochthonous NOM sources in the wet season. The structural changes to NOM that occurred seasonally are a strong indicator that site-specific calibrations should be performed at least a few times a year if DOC/NOM is monitoried by UV-Vis *in-situ*. DOC concentrations were typically higher than BC source water Guidelines suggest, however it should be noted that if Leech River water is transferred to a reservoir prior to treatment that NOM is likely to be photodegraded or diminished through microbial processing.

The primary objectives of this project were to characterize the range of hydrochemical dynamics and synchrony during rainfall response across the Leech watershed (~96 km^2^) and its nested catchments (ranging in size from 9.6 to 37 km^2^). To understand spatial and temporal patterns in hydrochemical dynamics, this research was tackled in two key ways: (1) six sub-basin sites were equipped with vertical racks which logged river stage, air and water temperature at 10-minute intervals and passively collected whole water samples during stormflow on rising limbs of the hydrograph;  and  (2) thirteen sites, including the six sub-basin sites, were sampled synoptically every two to four weeks. Results of both the synoptic sampling and sub-basin monitoring were used to characterize the temporal and spatial range of DOC concentrations and DOM character. In addition to spatiotemporal dynamics, the sub-basin monitoring sites were used to evaluate hydrologic responses based on  river rise (stream stage) and local precipitation. The vertical racks installed at the sub-basin sites acheived enhanced synoptic sampling program by collecting samples at multiple locations (near-simultaneously) across the watershed during rainfall-induced hydrologic surges, samples which would have been challenging and dangerous to collect manually. DOC concentration trends in stormflow were indicative of whether aqueous DOM was supply-limited or governed by hydrologic forcing. The data collected were used to elucidate spatiotemporal synchrony among sub-catchments. Results of synoptic sampling (including stormflow samples) were used to evaluate temporal trends with respect to seasonal dynaimcs of DOM characteristics. 


Despite the high RSD for headwaters sites, and the ~50% difference in area of these two sub-basins, LeechHead did show approximately the median of the two sub-basins DOC.


Across the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA), the timing of changes in temperature, river response and DOC concentrations and character were synchornized in the five nested catchments and Leech River Tunnel site (future point of diversion, or mouth of the WSA), however the mean values and magnitude of these changes differed between sites. 


Q) Across the LWSA, was the variance in DOC greater within each site or among all sites?

Q) Was the variance in DOC greater at the watershed outlet than the variance in each subbasin?  

*Seasonal trends and DOC over time
Based on spectroscopic indications that dry season NOM was less aromatic in character, it's quite possibly that the increase in summer DOC was due to autochthonous sources such as algae and cyanobacteria, while fall DOC was likely sources from autochthonous terrestrial sources (e.g., humic and fluvic acids).
