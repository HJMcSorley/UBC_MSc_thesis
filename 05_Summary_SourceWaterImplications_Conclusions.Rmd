This chapter summarizes results from Chapters two to four and discusses them in context of a forested drinking water supply with interpretation of watershed attributes and environmental conditions as possible drivers for variability. Results are discussed through the lens of supplemental source drinking water and treatability.  

\  

### Recap and synopsis of results

Stream water samples were collected from across the Greater Victoria Water Supply Area (GVWSA) and aqueous natural organic matter (NOM) was evaluated for concentration and character. The complex organic assembly that comprises NOM can be estimated by quantifying the organic carbon that forms its backbone. The molecular structure of NOM can vary from large, highly aromatic compounds to smaller aliphatic molecules and differences can be attributed to the source material. Terrestrial humic substances (i.e. allochthonous NOM) tends to be higher molecular weight, larger and more aromatic in structure; while in-stream sources of NOM (i.e. autochthonous NOM), such as algae, is typically more aliphatic and protein-like in structure. The quantity of aqueous NOM was measured as the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in each sample. The molecular quality of NOM was assessed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry; the specific absorbance coefficient at 254 nm (SAC~254~) was used as an indicator of NOM molecular aromaticity and reactivity [@Weishaar2003; @Vidon2008; @Abbott2018], and the quotient of SAC at 250 nm and 365 nm (E~2~:E~3~) was used to indicate (inversely) aromaticity and molecular size of aquatic humic solutes [@Peuravuori1997; @Helms2008].

\    

Quantities and qualities of NOM vary over space and through time; understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of concentrations and character can help to inform source drinking water management decisions by providing insights to the origins, transport and fate of aqueous NOM and other parameters associated with it. For example, NOM can bind and transport metals in solution [@LaZerte1991; @Aiken2011] and DOC was positively correlated to the concentrations of total mercury, iron, manganese, and aluminum as well as (to a lesser degree) barium, copper, and arsenic (Appendix XXXX). Additionally, NOM in drinking source water supply is partially responsible for the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in treated drinking water (Appendix NNNNN; @Yang2015; @Chow2008; @Beauchamp2018). 

\  

Vertical Racks for passive event sampling were coupled with synoptic Grab sampling campaigns to measuring water quality changes over 16 months, through events, and across the GVWSA. A challenge of Vertical Rack sampling is that high water can prohibit safe retrieval of collected samples from the Racks. Coupling continuously recorded stage with manually recorded siphon bottle heights allowed for calculation of sample hold-times and quality control measures for samples that had exceeded an acceptable holding time (Chapter 2). Siphon sampling by Vertical Racks is currently limited to the rising hydrograph limb, but the combination of Grab and refined Rack sampling can achieve good representation of reliable samples across the hydrograph.

\  

#### Spatiotemporal dynamics in the quantity and quality of NOM

The sampling period spanned sixteen months, from October 2018 to February 2020. Seasons were defined as 'wet' and 'dry' and were distinguished by the activity of passive Vertical Rack sample collection. The wet season was characterized by conditions that generated event responses which triggered rising-stage sample collection in the six Leech WSA monitoring site streams (Chapter 2). Based on this definition of seasons, Vertical Rack samples were only collected in the wet season (fall/winter/spring) while Grab samples were collected throughout the entire sampling period. Sampling began after the start of the 2018/2019 wet season, which extended until mid-May 2019. The dry season spanned from mid-May to late September 2019, which is when the 2019/2020 wet season began. 

\  

Results from twelve synoptically sampled sites across the GVWSA were used to assess broad spatial and temporal patterns in stream NOM dynamics (Chapter 3). More in-depth analyses were completed for six of those sites which were equipped with vertical sampling racks (Chapter 4). Synoptic sampling results showed broad spatiotemporal patterns that were predicted by the river continuum concept (RCC), including higher NOM concentrations in headwaters with longitudinal reduction in concentration along the reach, and a seasonal character shift from autochthonous to allochthonous sources. Analyses of Leech WSA monitoring sites showed that the upstream-to-downstream NOM molecular character patterns changed between seasons, with an increase in aromaticity during the dry season and a decrease in the wet season. The decrease in NOM aromaticity from low to high order streams, observed in the wet seasons, was expected due to dilution effects. In contrast, it was not expected that higher order streams would have more aromatic NOM than lower order streams during the dry season. During downstream transport at low flows, is was expected that NOM would decrease in aromaticity due to abiotic or biotic oxidation (e.g. photodegradation, heterotrophic processing). The observed elevation in downstream NOM aromaticity during the dry season suggests humic inputs from NOM rich tributaries at higher order streams, or perhaps in-stream microbial processing of terrestrial organic matter (e.g. leaf litter) generated aqueous humic solutes. .

\  

Spatial NOM patterns showed greater concentrations of more aromatic NOM in sub-basins draining the west of the Leech WSA, with lower concentrations of less aromatic NOM in basins draining from the east.

* In the wet season, when hydrologic connectivity was greatest, the West Leech sub-basin had aromaticity and molecular size comparable to that of the wetland and lake-dominated Weeks crk sub-basin; though in the dry season, Weeks crk maintained highly aromatic character of stream NOM while the other sub-basins had lower molecular wight, less aromatic NOM than was found at the Tunnel site. The dry season spatial pattern of NOM quality was not expected. Based on the RCC, it was expected that there would be a spatial reduction in NOM character from headwaters to mouth. However, in the dry season, samples collected at the highest order stream (at the future point of diversion) were more aromatic in NOM character than all of the nested catchments except for Weeks crk, which maintained highly aromatic NOM throughout the year due to proximity to the wetlands of Weeks Lake.  


* storm responses: early in the wet season there was a decrease in NOM concentration with increasing flows (higher stage), and as the wet season progresses, stream NOM concentration and aromaticity increased with increasing flows.


Spatial variation in fluvial water quality can be attributed to hydrological processes and watershed characteristics, as described by the river continuum concept and the pulse-shunt concept [@Vannote1980; @Raymond2016].

Important watershed characteristics include geomorphic variables, physical impoundments, organic matter inputs and sources, mass transport, solar inputs, and processing by aquatic invertebrates and microbes [@Stanley2012; @Aiken2011; @Zarnetske2018]. 

 

predicts a temporal shift in NOM character from autochthonous (e.g. algal) to allochthonous (e.g. humic material) sources, and a spatial reduction in NOM molecular diversity from headwaters to river mouth. 

The river continuum concept (RCC) explains temporal changes in NOM character through variable mobilization of source material and biogeochemical processing. 

Spatial-scaling of NOM diversity is 



##### Drivers for variation

Data from six sub-basin stream monitoring sites in the Leech WSA were used to assess sampling conditions and watershed characteristic variable importance for predicting NOM concentration and character.   

* Aqueous NOM dynamics were largely driven by warm and wet conditions across the Leech WSA. 
* wetness connecting 
* Watershed characteristics, such as sub-basin parent materials and forest structure (age and logging history) are likely responsible for some spatial variation in stream water quality. In conjunction with physical characteristics of the watershed, hydrologic conditions are primarily responsible for temporal variations observeds in stream water quality. 

... It appeared that when streams were near 75% of their maximum stage (therefore, approximately 0.75 of peak flow) humic source pools reached maximum connectivity with the streams... this could be explained by...
* the apparent stage threshold for peak DOC (~0.75 of max sampling stage) suggests a point at which allochthonous (humic) NOM supply reached maximum connectivity with the streams. This threshold could also indicate a point at with the event hydrograph was separated from soil water contributions and throughflow to overland flow and throughfall [@Penna2019].

Mean DOC among the six sites was essentially the same in both the wet and dry seasons (Chapter 3), but spatial patterns differed between the seasons. In the dry season, aqueous NOM aromaticity increased from upstream to downstream monitoring sites; while the wet season showed effects of dilution on both the quantity and quality of NOM. These seasonal differences support both a shift in NOM source material and a shift from NOM processing in the dry season and transport/dilution effects in the wet season.

Longitudinal attenuation in DOC (decreasing concentrations from upstream to downstream) and SAC~254~ were observed across the sampling sites as was a seasonal shift from autochthonous NOM sources in the dry season to allochthonous NOM sources in the wet season. The structural changes to NOM that occurred seasonally are a strong indicator that site-specific calibrations should be performed at least a few times a year if DOC/NOM is monitoried by UV-Vis *in-situ*. DOC concentrations were typically higher than BC source water Guidelines suggest, however it should be noted that if Leech River water is transferred to a reservoir prior to treatment that NOM is likely to be photodegraded or diminished through microbial processing.

#### Caveats and limitations

It was assumed that the UV-Vis spectral absorbances for each stream water sample were due to the natural organic matter content, however it is possible that other water quality variables could cause interference. For example, dissolved or colloidal nitrate, nitrite and iron species can absorb light at 250 nm, 254 nm or 365 nm, the wavelengths common to NOM absorption [@StdMet5910].

* in progress: this section will be included in the next draft, following feedback on results

The primary objectives of this project were to characterize the range of hydrochemical dynamics and synchrony during rainfall response across the Leech watershed (~96 km^2^) and its nested catchments (ranging in size from 9.6 to 37 km^2^). To understand spatial and temporal patterns in hydrochemical dynamics, this research was tackled in two key ways: (1) six sub-basin sites were equipped with vertical racks which logged river stage, air and water temperature at 10-minute intervals and passively collected whole water samples during stormflow on rising limbs of the hydrograph;  and  (2) thirteen sites, including the six sub-basin sites, were sampled synoptically every two to four weeks. Results of both the synoptic sampling and sub-basin monitoring were used to characterize the temporal and spatial range of DOC concentrations and DOM character. In addition to spatiotemporal dynamics, the sub-basin monitoring sites were used to evaluate hydrologic responses based on  river rise (stream stage) and local precipitation. The vertical racks installed at the sub-basin sites acheived enhanced synoptic sampling program by collecting samples at multiple locations (near-simultaneously) across the watershed during rainfall-induced hydrologic surges, samples which would have been challenging and dangerous to collect manually. DOC concentration trends in stormflow were indicative of whether aqueous DOM was supply-limited or governed by hydrologic forcing. The data collected were used to elucidate spatiotemporal synchrony among sub-catchments. Results of synoptic sampling (including stormflow samples) were used to evaluate temporal trends with respect to seasonal dynaimcs of DOM characteristics. 


Despite the high RSD for headwaters sites, and the ~50% difference in area of these two sub-basins, LeechHead did show approximately the median of the two sub-basins DOC.


Across the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA), the timing of changes in temperature, river response and DOC concentrations and character were synchornized in the five nested catchments and Leech River Tunnel site (future point of diversion, or mouth of the WSA), however the mean values and magnitude of these changes differed between sites. 


Q) Across the LWSA, was the variance in DOC greater within each site or among all sites?

Q) Was the variance in DOC greater at the watershed outlet than the variance in each subbasin?  

*Seasonal trends and DOC over time
Based on spectroscopic indications that dry season NOM was less aromatic in character, it's quite possibly that the increase in summer DOC was due to autochthonous sources such as algae and cyanobacteria, while fall DOC was likely sources from autochthonous terrestrial sources (e.g., humic and fluvic acids).
