For help with field installations and streamflow gauging, a big thanks to my former field partner, Stewart Butler, of Bill Floyd's Coastal Hydrology Research Lab; thanks Stew. Thanks also to Alison Bishop for field assistance during the winter of 2019/2020.    

For the love of data science, I am grateful for Jenny Byran's online resources, StackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com) for the solution to so many coding challenges. Thank you to RStudio for making a functional and friendly IDE for the R programming language and to GitHub for making version control streamlined and reproducibls. Cheers to Hadley Wickham for the tidyverse, Yihui Xie for the bookdown package (in which I wrote this thesis), and Jake Lever (https://github.com/jakelever) for making the R bookdown skeleton code for a UBC thesis available on GitHub.

Last but certainly not least, thanks to my friends and family for encouraging and supporting me in my scientific and academic pursuits. I really appreciate all the love.
