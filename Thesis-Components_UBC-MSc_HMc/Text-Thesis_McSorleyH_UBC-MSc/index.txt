# Abstract

This research contributes to understanding the "natural" variability in DOM and DOC across a forested riverine watershed: the Leech River watershed on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Land-use impacts are minimal in this research area as 96% of the watershed is protected as drinking water supply area (Leech Water Supply Area). Like most forested areas on Vancouver Island, the Leech watershed is second-growth softwood forest with a history of extensive harvest (nearly 96% cleared).

The purpose of this master's research project was to establish a baseline understanding of hydrologic responses and water quality variability in rivers across the LWSA. The approach includes advanced synoptic sampling within stormflow, supplemented with standard grab samples between storm events and during summer baseflow. Discrete samples of river water were collected passively during the rising limb of stormflow (falling limb prototype in progress) using low-powered, low-cost, custom-built vertical rack samplers including water level loggers (Odyssey) and observational reference staff gauges. By collecting samples during stormflow, a more robust understanding of water quality dynamics was achieved than basic grab sampling alone. Using low-powered passive sampling techniques allowed for multiple (six) sites to be equipped with monitoring/sampling racks, providing fairly good spatial resolution of hydrochemical variability across the watershed.

For help with field installations and streamflow gauging, a big thanks to my former field partner, Stewart Butler, of Bill Floyd's Coastal Hydrology Research Lab; thanks Stew. Thanks also to Alison Bishop for field assistance during the winter of 2019/2020.    

For the love of data science, I am grateful for Jenny Byran's online resources, StackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com) for the solution to so many coding challenges. Thank you to RStudio for making a functional and friendly IDE for the R programming language and to GitHub for making version control streamlined and reproducibls. Cheers to Hadley Wickham for the tidyverse, Yihui Xie for the bookdown package (in which I wrote this thesis), and Jake Lever (https://github.com/jakelever) for making the R bookdown skeleton code for a UBC thesis available on GitHub.

Last but certainly not least, thanks to my friends and family for encouraging and supporting me in my scientific and academic pursuits. I really appreciate all the love.
