"Not only is it vital to all biological functions on earth, water links abiotic and biotic, connects the earth to the atmosphere, and creates a dynamic fluid continuum between ecosystems." ~ Hannah McSorley

#1	Introduction
##1.1 		Forested source water supplies and drinking water treatment 
	
Surface water is the primary source of drinking water for over 85% of the Canadian population and in the province of British Columbia, approximately 80% of drinking water originates from forested headwaters [@Pike2010]. Forests offer a variety of ecosystem services (e.g. biodiversity) and also slow and filter runoff, resulting in high quality source water supply [@Dudley2003]. However, forests also contribute considerable amounts of terrestrial organic matter, bacteria and viruses to surface water [@REFS !@!@!]. There are natural variations in surface water quality over time and space due to climate, weather, and physical characteristics of the watershed (such as topography, land cover and geology) with terrestrial sediments, nutrients, and organic material (e.g. leaf litter) entering surface water through erosion and precipitation events [@Pike2010; @Johnson1997; @Delpla2016; @HealthCanada2019; @Yang2015]. 

 In Canada, all source water is treated to meet Health Canada drinking water quality guidelines, which specify allowable levels of biological, physical and chemical parameters that are safe for human use and consumption [@BC2019]. Drinking water treatment processes vary from chlorination alone (at the simplest level) to multiple stages of chemically assisted filtration in combination with advanced oxidative processes. Water treatment protocols differ between communities based on source water quality, infrastructure capabilities, budget, and regional water quality regulations [REFS]. Chlorination remains the most widely used method of inactivating potentially harmful microorganisms, whether it stands alone as the primary and sole treatment protocol, or is used in combination with other processes [@HealthCanada2006; HealthLinkBC2018]. 
 
 When natural source water is chlorinated, chemical reactions with natural organic matter (NOM) can form a variety of chlorinated organic compounds which are broadly classified as disinfection by-products (DBPs). [@Richardson2007; @Delpla2016; @HealthCanada2019; @Yang2015; @Hua2015; @StdMet2000]. A number of DBPs are included in Health Canada's drinking water quality guidelines, and have maximum allowable concentrations in treated water due to their potential or known health affects (i.e. genotoxicity and carcinogenicity) [@Richardson2007; @BC2019].   
 
	##1.2 		DOC & NOM variability (stormflow, seasons, spatial)

Natural organic matter (NOM) comprises a dynamic collection of molecules from a variety of sources. NOM can be introduced to a water body from terrestrial sources (allochthonous NOM), or generated through in-stream processes (autochthonous NOM). Terrestrial organic matter includes humic and fluvic acids, tannins, and a wide variety of other compounds (e.g. phenols and lignin, hydrocarbons, proteins, carbohydrates, etc.), which enter fresh water through runoff processes [@HealthCanada2019].  
Aqueous NOM composes complex and diverse combinations of particulate, colloidal and dissolved fractions. 

The dissolved portion of NOM (DOM) travels in solution and may therefore be transported further than particulate NOM which tends to settle out [@REFSREFSREFS].

Within a watershed, characteristics and concentrations of DOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, a major fraction of DOM) naturally fluctuate over space and through time [@Li2014, @Yang2015]. The treatability of source water varies with NOM concentration and character, which depend on source material, hydrology, and biogeochemical factors the factors that influence DOM [@Aiken2011].	
 
 The molecular composition and physical structure of NOM influence its reactivity, therefore different types of NOM have different DBP formation potentials (DBP-FP) [@Delpla2016; @Yang2015; @HealthCanada2019; @Chow2008]. NOM is a diverse family of molecules, which contain nitrogen, silica, oxygen and hydrogen but are composed primarily of organic carbon, therefore organic carbon is often measured as a proxy for NOM concentration [@HealthCanada2019]. Total organic carbon (TOC) is operationally divided into particulate and dissolved fractions (POC and DOC, respectively). The separation of these two fractions is (fairly arbitrarily) based on separation through a 0.45-micron filter [@StdMet2000; @Aiken2011]. DOC is typically the predominant component of TOC and in general, the concentration of DOC in raw water is proportional to DBPs in treated water [@Weishaar2003; @Chow2008]. Because NOM is a precursor for DBPs, and TOC is a surrogate measure of NOM, source water quality guidelines in British Columbia specify that TOC should remain below 4mg/L in source water [@BC2019]. As DOC is likely to generate DBPs during chlorination, it is an important source water quality parameter to monitor. 
 
 In addition to acting as a precursor for DBPs, NOM has the ability to bind and transport contaminants in solution (e.g. metals, organic pollutants, nutrients) and influence stream pH, light and temperature regimes [@Oni2013; @Aiken2011; @Weishaar2003; @LaZerte1991; @Palleiro2013; @Stanley2012].
 
 !and, because it is an energy source for aquatic heterotrophic microbes, NOM !can contribute to biofouling water supply infrastructure and lead to service !disruption in treatment plants [@Stanley2012]

	##1.3 		Watershed processes and water quality
	
Streams are intrinsically linked to their watersheds through dynamic biotic-abiotic interactions and hydroclimatic relationships and as a result, aqueous biogeochemicals represent an important link between ecosystem processes, hydrology, and water resources. Biogeochemical signatures are useful tracers to better understand catchment processes and regional hydrology, as they are indicative of flow paths, sources, chemical origins and transport pathways [@Abbott2018; @Meyer1983; @Vidon2008; @Rautu2019]. The origins, transport and fate of biogeochemicals in source waters is important for drinking water treatment, because the quality of source water (physiochemical composition and character) governs treatment requirements and largely dictates the quality of treated water -- particularly with respect to disinfection byproducts. 

Characteristics of discharge and precipitation are the primary controls on stream DOC concentrations [@Vidon2008]. Hydrologic pulses can cause temporal variability in subcatchment water quality, depending on the synchrony (i.e. mean covariance among subcatchments) of the pulse generation [@Abbott2018]. The character of DOM has been shown to vary during storms, indicating a change in NOM source over the course of the event [@Vidon2008]. 

		###1.3.1 	Natural variation
In pristine watersheds, water quality parameters exhibit natural variability across a river network due to dynamic biotic and abiotic interactions. For example, the river continuum concept (RCC) predicts a spatial reduction in DOM molecular diversity from headwaters, where a majority of solutes enter aquatic ecosystems, to river mouth (i.e., decreasing DOM diversity from low to high order streams) [@Vannote1980; @Mosher2015; @Abbott2018]. Longitudinal attenuation of DOM diversity can be explained by a combination of hydrological processes, geomorphic variables and physical impoundments, organic matter inputs and sources, sediment transport, solar inputs, and processing by aquatic invertebrates and microbes [@Vannote1980; @Stanley2012]. The RCC also predicts a temporal shift in DOM character, including a seasonal shift between heterotrophic processing of detritus to autotrophic generation of NOM (i.e. allochthonous to autochthonous DOM character) [@Vannote1980; @Meyer1983].

Robust analyses by Abbott _et al_ [-@Abbott2018] showed greater biogeochemical diversity in headwaters relative to downstream variance, but did not support the RCC theory of greater temporal variance in headwaters. Solutes were found to vary synchronously among upstream and downstream sites, leading to temporal stability in biogeochemical signatures despite longitudinal variability [@Abbott2018]. The synchrony of hydrochemical variance lead to relatively stable spatial patterns over seasonal and decadal time scales [@Abbott2018].     

		###1.3.2 	Catchment disturbances

Land use (e.g., forest management) and landscape disturbances can ultimately effect water treatability by altering material inputs, biogeochemical processes and stream ecology, as well as changing preferential flow-paths and the mobilization, transport and dilution of biogeochemcial components [@Meyer1983]. 
It has been shown that, two to three years post-harvest, baseflow DOC concentrations were higher in forested catchments than in clear-cut catchments; however, these studies also showed variable stormflow DOC responses in harvested and forested catchments [@Meyer1983; @Mistick2019]. In the absence of long-term baseline data (i.e., pre and post-disturbance data sets), natural variability in fluvial processes complicates land-use studies. Anthropogenic climate change can further confound our interpretation of catchment studies.  

Overall, DOC trends related to land-use seem highly dependent on catchment attributes.  

High intensity and/or long duration precipitation events can deplete both terrestrial and aquatic NOM storage sources (e.g. high flows can disturb benthic NOM storage) [@Meyer1983].

-- DOC is higher on the rising limb of a hydrograph, and tends to decrease as streamflow recedes [@REFS].   


	##1.4 	forWater & CRD GVWSA

		###1.4.1 		forWater 

The NSERC Strategic Network, forWater, is a transdisciplinary cross-Canada applied research collaboration focused on the connections between treated drinking water quality and land-use impacts of forest management. The majority of source drinking water originates in forested headwaters, but the connection between upstream forest management and downstream treatment remains poorly understood. forWater researchers are studying water quality in watersheds across Canada, under a variety of different forest management strategies. Through collaborative analyses, forWater is working to evaluate source water treatability metrics, downstream propagation effects, and resource economic with the ultimate goal of providing a framework for treatement demands.

  
		###1.3.2		Greater Victoria Water Supply Areas
The Capital Regional District, a forWater Partner, is committed to the multiple barrier approach to clean drinking water and has taken control of source water protection by purchasing and privatizing the water supply areas for Greater Victoria.   		
		
The Capital Regional District (CRD) owns *205.49* km^2^ (20,549 hectares) of catchment lands. Currently, Greater Victoria's water supply is sourced from five surface water reservoirs in the Sooke and Goldstream watersheds (*109.27* km^2^  total), located on southeastern Vancouver Island, British Columbia.  **these don't add up**

In 2007 and 2010, the CRD purchased and additional *96.28* km^2^ (9,628 hectares) of land which included the majority of the Leech River watershed (a major sub-catchment of the Sooke River watershed). In anticipation of future water demands, this area was designated as a supplemental water supply Greater Victoria: the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA). In the future (possibly by 2050), inter-basin transfer will supplement the primary drinking water supply by moving Leech River water through a diversion tunnel to Sooke Reservoir. Approximately 92% of the Leech River watershed above the point of diversion (Leech Tunnel) is protected as WSA. 

			####1.3.2.1 	Forest Management
Previously, the LWSA was privately managed forest land which was extensively harvested over the past 70 years (nearly 96% clearcut); as a result, a large portion of the WSA is densely forested with softwood stands less than 35 years of age. The second growth forests of the LWSA are no longer managed for timber supply, they are now managed to improve drinking source water quality and to reduce the risk of landscape level wildfire. Due to harvest, reforestation and active fire suppression, forest fire fuels have accumulated and pose a threat in the event that a fire occurs. In the Sooke WSA, the CRD implements forest treatments designed to foster healthy forest stands capable of reducing fire intensity, such as reducing fuel hazards and creating conditions that are safe for crews to action a fire. Similarly, preventative fire treatments may be applied in the LWSA prior to inter-basin transfers. Developing an understanding of baseline water quality dynamics and hydrologic forces in the LWSA will help to inform forest management strategies by evaluating the effects of fire fuel management on water supply.     

			####1.3.2.2 	Greater Victoria Drinking Water Treatment 
Island Health is the Vancouver Island Health Authority which oversees drinking water systems regulated under the provincial Drinking Water Protection Act and Drinking Water Protection Regulation frameworks. In keeping with Health Canada's drinking water quality guidelines, the Act sets out requirements for drinking water operators & suppliers to ensure the provision of safe drinking water. The CRD complies with all drinking water requirements as well as several that are not enforced in the province of BC. Treatment of source water from the Greater Victoria Water Supply Area is fairly simple: raw water (unfiltered) is treated with ultraviolet light as primary disinfection, chlorination is secondary  ( *free*{switched from liquid to gas in 2018??} chlorine), and finally ammonia is added to produce chloramine (ClNH~2~, a long-lasting disinfectant that persists through distribution). Understanding dynamics and variability of hydrochemistry in the LWSA is needed to anticipate possible treatment challenges that may accompany future inter-basin transfer from the LWSA.   


	##1.4 	Research Objectives
	
As a member of the Watershed Science and Forest Management Theme of forWater, this research was conducted in partnership with the CRD to contribute to their pursuit of characterizing the LWSA, while contributing to our understanding of "natural" variations in source water quality (primarily with respect to NOM and DOC) across nested catchments in a second growth forested watershed. 

The objectives of this research were to quantify spatial and temporal patterns in DOC concentrations, and indicate the hydrochemical synchrony of nested catchments across the LWSA. Ideally, this research will contribute to a baseline dataset on which the impacts of source water supply forest management strategies can be explored further (i.e., fire fuel management and water quality).
