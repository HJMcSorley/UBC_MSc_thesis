# Background
## NSERC forWater Network for Forested Drinking Water Source Protection Technologies

The forWater Network is a cross-Canada collaborative research network designed to gain insights about drinking source water treatability as it relates to forest management. Forest management includes (but is not limited to) timber harvesting strategies, forest regeneration and replanting, pre-commercial thinning and treatments, and preventative risk reduction. The forWater Network aims to evaluate the impacts that forest management has on fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrients, as well as composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and turbidity, as these are key parameters that can create impediments to effective drinking water treatment and disinfection. The anticipated outcome of the forWater Network is to inform a range of treatability scenarios and implications.   

The forWater Network is a transdisciplinary organization composed of four research themes that collaborate to understand the link between forested source water quality and drinking water treatability. 
	Theme-1: Watershed Science & Forest Management 
	Theme-2: Downstream Effects Propagation
	Theme-3: Water Treatability
	Theme-4: Resource Economics
	
The forWater Network ("forWater") offers the ability to leverage the "economy of scale" by completing collaborative sample collection, analyses, and data sharing. Theme-1 research groups complete field work and sampling campaigns and share samples with Themes 2 & 3 for specialized analyses, the results of which are circulated back to Theme-1 and passed to Theme-4 for financial evaluation.  The research presented in this thesis contributes to objectives of Theme-1 (Watershed Science and Forest Management). 

## Greater Victoria Regional Water Supply System  
The Capital Regional District (CRD) owns and operates the water supply system for the Greater Victoria region. As a water purveyor, CRD supplies an average of 130 million liters of treated water to customers each day [@CapitalRegionDistrict2017]. The provision of safe and sustainable drinking water is regulated by three bodies above the CRD: federal, provincial, and regional. Health Canada (federal government) publishes Canadian Drinking Water Quality Guidelines which outline quantitative bounds for microbial, chemical, radiological parameters and physical aesthetic characteristics of safe drinking water. Through the Public Health Act and Regulation, the Drinking Water Protection Act and the Water Sustainability Act, the province of British Columbia sets requirements for planning, reporting and regualting of drinking water providers. The Vancouver Island Health Authority, Island Health, is the agency that the CRD reports to regarding water quality information and provincial legislation.    

The Greater Victoria Water Supply Area (GVWSA) includes 20,549 hectares (205.49 km^2^) of protected drinking water catchment lands. The primary water supply is sourced from Sooke reservoir, secondary supply source is Goldstream reservoir and the designated (supplemental) future water supply is the Leech River watershed. Unfiltered source water is first treated with ultraviolet light (to deactivate parasites) and free chlorine (to deactive bacteria and viruses); secondarily, ammonia is added to produce chloramine, a long-lasting disinfectant [@CapitalRegionDistrict2017].  
 
The Leech River watershed is adjacent to Sooke Reservoir, which is the primary water supply for the Greater Victoria Area. In anticipation of future water demands and uncertainty related to rainfall and climate change, the Capital Regional District (CRD) purchased 9,628 hectares (about 92%) of the Leech River watershed in 2007 () and 2010 (), and designated the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA) as future supplemental water supply. The Leech Tunnel was constructed in the 1980's to transfer Leech River water into the Sooke watershed.  The Tunnel is not currently operational, and it's anticipated that inter-basin transfer won't be required until 2050 or later.  

>To prepare for the eventual use of the LWSA, further work is required to plan for the water quality impacts of the different raw water sources, rehabilitation of the water supply area forests and drainage structures, and infrastructure necessary to convey the LWSA flows into Sooke Lake Reservoir

# Study area: the Leech River Watershed, future water supply area (Leech Water Supply Area)

The Leech River watershed is located on south-east Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The area is in the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone. The hydroclimatic regime for the Leech watershed is pluvial (rain-dominated climate). Annual rainfall is typically between xxxx - yyyy mm (~2500 mm/yr). This areas has a strong seasonal distribution of rainfall: approximately 90% of rain falls from September to April, with only about 10% of annual rainfall occurring from May to August. The watershed forests are dominated by western red cedar, hemlock, and Douglas fir.

Prior to purchase by the CRD, the LWSA was privately managed forest land. Approximately 96% of the Leech watershed was harvested by clear cut. The majority **(?% of total area)** of the LWSA forests are under 30 years of age. Now designated as a Water Supply Area, the Leech is managed by the CRD for source water protection, ecosystem services, and forest resilience. As forest fires pose a serious threat to monocultured and even-aged stands (**REFS**), particularly during the drought of summer, forest fuel management is a key preemptive risk reduction for the CRD. 
*** DID LEECH GET P.C.T & WAS IT PLANTED**  -- {** pre-commercial thinning 5-10yrs after regen, versus 20 yrs, versus problem**}

The Leech River system is composed of three main stem rivers, numerous tributaries, and four small headwater lakes. The rivers are flashy: they respond rapidly to rain events, rising and falling dramatically. The hydrology of the LWSA is poorly understood, as is the water quality. In the mid-1980's, some water was transfered from the Leech River into Deception Gulch and Reservoir (adjacent but physically separated from Sooke Reservoir). The mixing resulted in biological water quality problems that included odour and raised concerns about the operational usage of the existing tunnel. The Leech River Tunnel and anticipated inter-basin transfer will provide interesting research opportunities, but is beyond the scope of this thesis research. Before work is done on inter-basin transfers, the hydrology and water quality of the Leech River system need to be better understood. The timing and magnitude of flows is important to accommodate the water license that the CRD holds for **winter** withdraws from the Leech. Understanding source water quality is an essential part of managing water supply and a foundation of the multiple barrier approach to clean drinking water.       

This thesis research bridges the CRD's commitment to planning for the future use of the LWSA with the objectives of the forWater Network, by establishing an understanding of "natural" hydrochemical variability across a forested source water area. The caveat on the term "natural" is to say that the majority (** HOW MANY **) of forested ecosystems on Vancouver Island are second growth forests which have been previously been harvested. The forest industry is a crucial component of BC's economic system, and essential to the lives that people on the coast are accustomed to. (** facts about forestry in BC **).


# Research Questions 

The research presented in this thesis focuses on describing the  spacial and temporal patterns and trends in water quality across the Leech River watershed, an area with a history of extensive forest harvest. Spatial variability was addressed by setting up parallel monitoring stations at six locations respresenting the headwaters and three main stem rivers of the Leech River system. Temporal variability was addressed at the seasonal scale via continuous 16 month study (October 2018 to February 2020), and on a shorter timeframe, at the scale of stormflow. The research questions addressed here were:
  
	1. How do water quality and hydrologic response vary across the Leech Water Supply Area?
	2. What are the temporal patterns in water quality changes, both seasonally and within stormflow?
	3.  Is there a dominant signature from one of the mainstems at the future point of diversion (Leech Tunnel), and what are the treatment implications?

Research objectives, based on these questions, were to: 
	* Monitor water quality and water level across the LWSA,
	* Identify differences and similarities between sites (spatial) and variations over time (temporal, short and relatively long scales),
	* Collaborate with forWater Network partners to assess the implications for drinking water treatment and relate findings to sub-basin characteristics. 
	
Tasks related to these research objectives were: site selection, method development, field installations, sample collection and analysis, data analysis and interpretation

# 	Research Sites 

Six sites were selected across the Leech Water Supply Area. The six research sites represent five nested catchments and the entire water supply area basin defined from the point of (future) diversion, the Leech Tunnel. 

| Site Number | Site Name | Characteristic | Drainage Area (km^2^) |    
|:------------|:----------|:---------------|:---------------------|
| 1   | Weeks Outlet  | Wetland-draining headwaters | 16.1 |
| 2   | Chris Creek | Headwaters | 9.6 |
| 3   | Leech River Head  | Mainstem river head | 26.2 |
| 4   | Cragg Creek | Mainstem river | 37.1 |
| 5   | West Leech River | Mainstem river | 35.2 |
| 6   | Leech River Tunnel| Future diversion point | 98.7 |

_Sites 1 and 2 monitor subcatchments of the site 3 drainage area._

**Note that Strahler order was used to define stream orders, such that a headwater creek is assigned first order, and the confluence of two headwater streams creates a second order stream, two second order streams join to become a third order, and so on (i.e headwaters are lowest number, mouth is highest). **

## 1. Weeks Outlet

Jordan Meadows wetland is located in the northwest of Leech River watershed, it drains to the east and joins the outflow of Weeks Lake (south end of the lake). The wetland and lake outflow streams join and flow east to Research Site #1, "Weeks Outlet", which is a third order stream (Strahler) of the western headwaters of Leech River. This research site has a drainage area of approximately 16 km^2^. The channel is fairly straight and bed material is primarily silt/clay. The water at this site was noteabley tannin-coloured.  This research site was located about 0.4 km west (upstream) of the confluence with Chris Creek. 
    
A large culvert upstream of the monitoring site was replace with a bridge in August of 2019. The culvert had been perched above the streambed level and was obstructing the movement of fish and water flow. Prior to the culvert removal, several groundwater seeps were observed downstream; these seeps maintained base flow of summer waters in this low-relief stream reach.  There were high levels of iron (above guidlines for aesthetic objectives) in the water downstream of the culvert, possibly due to culvert rust.

## 2. Chris Creek

Chris Creek is the western headwaters of Leech River. This research site is approximately 0.2 km east (upstream) of the confluence with the Weeks Outlet stream. The study site on Chris Creek monitors waters draining from approximately 9.6 km^2^ of forested land, including a small lake (Worley Lake). The monitoring site of Chris Creek was downstream of a bridge, on a slightly sinuous reach with boulders and bedrock dominated morphology and turbulent cascading step-pools. There is a brige that passes over Chris Creek and a large collection of coarse woody debris downstream of the bridge, upstream of the monitoring site.

## 3. Leech River Head

Research site 3 was approxiamtely 1.4 km downstream of the confluence of Weeks Outlet stream and Chris Creek. The "Leech Head" study site was in a deep pool between riffles, it's a 4th order stream with predominantly Schist bedrock and fairly low relief (~2%) and relatively straight morphology. The water at this site was often coloured by tannins (likely from the Weeks outlet stream contributions).  There once was a logging bridge across the river at this site, and some rip-rap remains on either bank.

## 4. Cragg Creek

Cragg Creek is a mainstem river that originates in the east of the Leech River watershed. Cragg Creek is a 4th order stream and this research site location has a drainage area of approximately 37 km^2^. The Cragg Creek research station was installed upstream of a road bridge, at a CRD hydrological monitoring site (installed over the span of this thesis project). The bed morphology at this site is Schist bedrock and the stream is straight channel with fairly high width-to-depth ratio. Upstream of the bridge Cragg Creek flows turbulently along a low slope, and downstream of the bridge it cascades into several deep pools. From the Cragg Creek research site, the river flows approximately 4.5 km through a steep revine to confluence with the Leech River (this confluence is around 6 km downstream of the Leech Head site, site #3).

## 5. West Leech River
Originating in the west of the Leech River watershed, West Leech River is a 4th order mainstem river. The West Leech research site monitors a drainage area of approximately 35 km^2^. This reasearch site has boulder and bedrock substrate, fairly straight channel with relatively high width-to-depth ratio and pool-riffle morphology. The West Leech site is approxiamtely 120m upstream of the confluence with Leech mainstem (~1.5km downstream of the confluence of Cragg Creek with Leech River).

## 6. Leech River Tunnel	

This research site is at the point of future diversion, the Leech Tunnel. The Leech River is 5th order, and this research site has a drainage area of approximately 99 km^2^. The streambed here is dominated by Schist bedrock and boulders. The bedrock in the center of the channel is deeply incised, but overall the river is wider than is is deep. The Tunnel site is approximately 1km downstream of the West Leech confluence.

# Methods

At each of the six reserach sites, a vertical sampling rack was installed. Each rack included a central stilling well (1.5" PCV pipe (conduit) with 1/2" holes drilled along the length) that had a measuring tape affixed to the front. Inside the stilling well is an [Odyssey Capacitance water level logger](http://odysseydatarecording.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=50). On either side of the central stilling well slotted offset angle bars were fixed. Siphon sampler bottles were attached to the slotted angle bars with hose clamps.

The siphon sampler bottles were based on a USGS single stage sediment sampler design (US U-59, 1961) which passively collect discrete water samples at a fixed stage on the rising limb of the hydrograph. The siphon samplers built for this research were 250 mL amber HDPE widemouth bottles with augmented screw caps. The caps were fit with two 1/4" (OD) stainless steel  ****Aluminum?*** tubes, one longer than the other, both with a 180$^\circ$ bend (**** better explanation?****). The lower tube acts as an inlet that intakes water once the stream level is at or above the crown of the bend, while the taller tube allows air to exit the sample bottle as it is displaced with water (air vent). Once the sample bottle is full, there is no exchange with the surrounding stream water due to an air lock created in the vent tube bend. **** the section on quality control addresses experimental results with confirm that samples collected with these rising limb siphon samplers are in fact discrete samples.*****

  

The benefits of these vertical racks as a method of sampling include: low cost (about $500 CND per installation, all in), low power (two 1/2-AA batteries in each logger), self-contained logger (no external power source or data logger required), customizable design, passive sampling (no pumps). 


# Weather during the period of study
During the period of research for this thesis, the Leech watershed experienced one of the wettest winter seasons on record (2018-2019), following a dry summer (2018). Summer 2019 was more mild than expected, with fewer days of high forest fire risk than the previous **three years**. The start of the 2019 wet season had high intensity early season rain events (early October 2019) followed by an extended dry period (through to mid November).

# Additional thoughts:

* How will source water with higher tannins (i.e Leech River water) affect the primary treatment process of UV disinfection (currently used for Sooke rerservoir water)? 
	* What are the operational limits of TOC (or tannins) in source water with respect to UVT system performance?
* Can UVT photodegrade TOC molecules such that DBP-FP is reduced? 
* Can UVT be used as a primary treatment to reduce the requirements for chemical filtration and reduce the solid waste generated by coagaulants?
