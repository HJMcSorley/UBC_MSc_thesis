	what did you do?
I installed 6 vertical rack samplers to collect water samples from headwater tributaries and mainstem rivers in a protected drinking water supply area to learn more about how water quality changes over time and space. Using vertical racks, I collected 15 months of water level and YYYY # of river water samples from when the rivers surged in response to rainfall. I also collected synoptic samples from YYYY number of sites to better understand the spatial variability in water quality at YYY # sites across the water supply area over a relavtively short period of time (sub-daily).  
Primarily, I analyzed the water samples for concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Additionally, I collected YYY cycles of grab samples for total metals analysis on behalf of the CRD (analysis completed by BV Labs, formerly Maxxam Analytical). 

	why tho?
why the Leech River Watershed -- the Leech is protected for future water supply for GVWSA, it is a second-growth forested catchment that was 96% harvested by clearcut and has been protected since 2007 and 2010.
why six sites -- the six sites I selected were accessible and important portions of the Leech River system: two headwater streams (Weeks and Chris Creek), the head of Leech River (below the confluence of the two headwaters), two mainstem rivers that feed the Leech (Cragg Creek and West Leech) and the Leech River at the future point of diversion (the Leech River Tunnel).

Globally, BBBBB% of drinking water originates in forested headwaters; in Canada, 80% of drinking water is supplied from forested source water areas [@ ]

The province of British Columbia is covered by YYYY% of forested area and UUUUU% has been harvested, meaning that the majority of forested drinking water supply is from second growth forests [@ ]. 

Forests offer a variety of ecosystem services, including biodiversity, Y and Z, and also slow and filter runoff, resulting in high quality source water supply [@Dudley2003, ]. In Canada, all source water is treated to meet Health Canada drinking water quality guidelines, which specify allowable levels of biological, physical and chemical parameters that are safe for human use and consumption [@ ]. Drinking water treatment processes vary from chlorination alone (at the simplest level) to multiple stages of chemically assisted filtration in combination with advanced oxidative processes [@ ]. Water treatment protocols differ between communities based on source water quality, infrastructure capabilities, budget, and regional water quality regulations [@ ]. Chlorination remains the most widely used method of inactivating potentially harmful microorganisms, whether it stands alone as the primary and sole treatment protocol, or is used in combination with other processes [@ ]. Chlorination of natural source water often results in the unintended production of disinfection byproducts (DBPs), which are halogenated conginers of natural organic matter (NOM). A number of DBPs are included in Health Canada's drinking water quality guidelines, and have maximum allowable concentrations in treated water due to their potential or known health affects (B, N, H, and Y) [@ ]. Because NOM reacts with chlorine to create DBPs, source water quality guidelines regulate NOM in water supply in an effort to minimize concentrations of DBPs in treated water. 

In addition to NOM acting as a precursor for DBPs, it also has the ability to bind and carry metals in solution as well as other contaminants (e.g. N, M & U), and is therefore an important parameter to monitor in source water. NOM is a diverse family of molecules, which are composed primarily of organic carbon (as well as nitrogen, silica, oxygen, ...) [@ ]. Because it composes a large portion of NOM, organic carbon can be measured as a proxy for NOM concentration. Total organic carbon (TOC) is composed of particulate and dissolved organic carbon fractions (POC and DOC, respectively). Generally, DOC comprises a larger component of TOC relative to POC, and is more likely to generate DBPs during treatment because it will not spontaneously settle out of solution [@ ]. Source water quality guidelines in British Columbia specify that TOC should not exceed 6mg/L in source water at any given time. 

Water quality, including a range of physiochemical and biological components, changes with time and changes across an area. For example, DOC is higher on the rising limb of a hydrograph, and tends to decrease as streamflow recedes [@].

- temperature and turbidity data available
- falling limb sampler deployed prior to big January event
- camera up
- permanent HFSG
*** all together, I have flow, concentrations (therefore flux), rising and falling limb of one event, plus ancillary data **

talk to Emily about help using the Aqualog and interpreting the results (get the files from her for analysis), ask for papers -- last storm flow samples, measure quality and quantity

Surface water is the primary source of drinking water for over 85% of the Canadian population, and in the province of British Columbia, approximately 80% of drinking water originates from forested headwaters [@Pike2010]. 

Surface water quality varies over time and space due to climate, weather, and physical characteristics of the watershed (such as topography, land cover and geology) with sediments, nutrients, and organic material (e.g. leaf litter) entering surface water through erosion and precipitation events [@Pike2010, @Johnson1997, @Delpla2016]. 

Terrestrial materials decompose and release complex and diverse combinations of dissolved organic matter (DOM). 
Surface water also contains microorganisms, which can be hazardous to human health and therefore require disinfection prior to distribution. 
The most common drinking water disinfectant used in Canada to inactivate hazardous microorganisms is chlorination [@HealthCanada2006, @HealthLinkBC2018]. When natural water is chlorinated, chemical reactions with DOM can form a variety of chlorinated organic compounds, broadly classified as disinfection by-products (DBPs), many of which are harmful to human health [@Richardson2007, @Delpla2016, @HealthLinkBC2018, @HealthCanada2006].
 The physical structure (molecular composition) of DOM influences its reactivity, therefore different types of DOM have different DBP formation potentials (DBP-FP) [@Delpla2016, @Yang2015].

Within a watershed, characteristics and concentrations of DOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, a major fraction of DOM) naturally fluctuate over space and through time [@Li2014, @Yang2015]. This means that the treatability of source water is variable.

Land use has

The direct effects of forest harvesting on headwater DOM chemistry remains poorly understood [@Pike2010, @Epps1994].

To understand the relationship of forestry activities to DOM and DBP-FP, research is needed to separate forestry impacts on DOM from natural DOM fluctuations. 

This research contributes to understanding the "natural" variability in DOM and DOC across a forested riverine watershed. Land-use impacts are minimal in this research area as 96% of the watershed is protected as drinking water supply area: the Leech River watershed on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Like most forested areas on Vancouver Island, the Leech watershed is second-growth softwood forest with a history of extensive harvest (nearly 96% cleared).

 # Vertical racks at six sites
  six sites were selected across the Leech River watershed system; three of these sites were located at the headwaters of Leech river, two were assiciated with the mainstem rivers that feed the Leech from the West and East, and one was at the Leech River Tunnel (the future point of diversion).

At each of these six sites, a vertical rack was installed.  

At each of the six research sites, a vertical sampling rack was installed. These racks collect discrete water samples as the river rises and record continuous stage measurements (at ten minute intervals). Vertical sampling racks supplement a synoptic sampling program by providing synchronized spatial resolution that would otherwise be difficult to achieve (i.e., multiple sites across the watershed), while collecting samples during flows that would otherwise be difficult or unsafe to access.  Each rack included a central stilling well (1.5" PCV pipe with 1/2" holes along the length) with a measuring tape affixed to the front; inside the stilling well was an [Odyssey Capacitance water level logger](http://odysseydatarecording.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=50); and on either side of the central stilling well was a slotted offset angle bar onto which hose clamps held sample bottles fit with siphon lids. By combining the stage observed on the stilling-well tape with logged river stage and the height at which each siphon bottle filled, the date and time for each rising-stage sample collection was determined. 

It is widely understood that DOC is higher during stormflow than during baseflow and these vertical racks collect whole water samples that can be analyzed to determine just how much stormflow increases the concentration of solutes relative to low-flow samples collected between storm peaks.   

The benefits of these vertical racks as a method of sampling include: low cost (about $500 CND per installation, all in), low power (two 1/2-AA batteries in each logger), self-contained logger (no external data logger required), customizable design, passive sampling (no pumps).
