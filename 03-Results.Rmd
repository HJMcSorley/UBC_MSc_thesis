#####   Rain events {#events}

LWSA mean FWx precipitation data were used to define rain events using the USGS *Rainmaker* package in R ('RMevents' function). During the study period there were 151 rain events, and 18 that were classified as major events. Major rain events were defined by precipitation accumulating to 50mm or more, where the events were separated from each other by a period of 14 hours or longer. Table \@ref(tab:Events) summarizes the eighteen major rain events that occurred during the study period (2018-10-23 to 2020-02-20).

\  

An intense (category 3-4) atmospheric river event hit the LWSA January 29-31 (Event 17) and generated incredible flows across the Leech watershed (and across Vancouver Island and most of the south coast of BC). Streamflow at CraggCrk (site 4) and the Tunnel (site 6) over-topped the vertical racks (greater than 2m tall) and ripped the level-loggers out of their stilling wells [^2]. Luckily, the level-loggers were found downstream in February and (after drying the circuit boards) the data were successfully retrieved from both Odyssey loggers. Figure \@ref(fig:EventsPlot) shows stream level at each monitored sub-basin along with events and samples collected. Eight of these events were captured in the 2019 water year (2018-2019 wet season), the other ten in the 2020 water year. For each calender year in the study period, major rain events' minimum and maximum values of depth, duration and intensity were identified and are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:MinMaxEvents).   

[^2]:   Following major event 17 (Jan 29-31), changes to the stream-bed morphology were evident at LeechHead (site 3) in the form of gravel and cobble deposition, there was evidence of substantial coarse woody debris transport at ChrisCrk (site 2), and destruction to hydrologic monitoring equipment at the Leech Tunnel.

###   Nested sub-catchments of the Leech watershed

Six locations across the Leech Water Supply Area (LWSA) were set up as monitoring sites where vertical racks were installed to measure continuous stage and collect water samples as the rivers rose in response to precipitation events. Figure \@ref(fig:megaplot) shows major precipitation events and stream response over the study period as well as the timing and stage of samples collected.

\ 

####    River response: spatial and temporal variance and synchrony in stage 

Across the LWSA, fluctuations in river stage were temporally synchronized. River responses among the six sites were confirmed to be congruent with high confidence (p-value < 0.001, based on 1050 randomizations) via Kendall's coefficient of concordance (Kendall's W = 0.9721) and Spearman's ranked correlation (ρ = 0.9666).

               col.names = c("site", "shortest time to peak stage (hr)", "fastest time to peak stage (hr)", "smallest change in stage (cm)", "largest change in stage (cm)", "fastest time to peak (cm/hr)", "slowest time to peak (cm/hr)"),
               caption = "*Summary of stream response to precipitation events across the LWSA.*")
```


#### Spatial variance in DOC concentrations

Sampling of the six research sites was achieved through a combination of vertical rack sampling and synoptic grab sampling. The number of river samples passively collected on vertical racks more than doubled the number of river samples collected by standard grab sampling. Vertical racks collected river samples on the rising hydrograph limb, which has been shown to have higher DOC concentration that non-storm flow [@Yang2015; @Raymond2016; @Raymond2010] and can be difficult or dangerous to capture by standard grab sampling, particularly across multiple sites. 


Indeed, samples with maximum DOC concentrations were captured by vertical racks at five of the six sites, with the exception of Leech River head (*'LeechHead'*, site 3) where peak DOC happened to be collected as a Grab sample (Table \@ref(tab:SixDOCsummarySampleType)).

\  

```{r SixDOCsummarySampleType}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/DOC-sixsite_summary_sample-type.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Site", "Sample type", "Sample count", "Mean DOC (mg/L)", "sd (± mg/L DOC)", "RSD (± %)", "Min. (mg/L)", "Median (mg/L)", "Max. (mg/L)"),
               digits = c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2),
               caption = "*Summary of DOC across the six LWSA installation sites including breakdown of sample type collected.*")
```

\  

Figure \@ref(fig:subbasinDOCbox) shows the distribution of DOC concentrations at each of the six sites. Highest concentrations and variance in DOC occurred at the Weeks Main creek headwater site (*'Weeks'*, site 1), a sub-basin in the northwest of the Leech watershed which includes Weeks Lake and surrounding wetlands. Lowest average concentration and variance in DOC was recorded at Cragg Creek (*'CraggCrk'*, site 4), a mainstem river that drains the east sub-basin of the Leech watershed, including Jarvis Lake and the western slopes of Survey Mountain. DOC concentration and variance at Leech River Tunnel (*'Tunnel'*, site 6) was similar to CraggCrk.

\  

```{r subbasinDOCbox, out.width = "100%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:subbasinDOCbox} *Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations across the Leech watershed over sixteen months, collected by standard grab sampling and on vertical racks (318 samples total).*"

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/DOC_subbasin_boxplots.png")
```

\  

As the Leech River Tunnel will be the point of diversion for future inter-basin transfers from Leech water supply area (LWSA) to the Sooke Reservoir basin, the Tunnel (site 6) is the effective outlet of the LWSA where runoff from each nested catchment is integrated. Similarly, Weeks and ChrisCrk (sites 1 & 2) are integrated at LeechHead (site 3), which is just below the headwaters' confluence. Table \@ref(tab:subbasinDOCtunnelint) summarizes the range and variability in DOC within each site and among all sites, with categorical groupings of sub-basins.

\  

```{r subbasinDOCtunnelint}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/DOC-Subbasin_summary_CategoryIntegration.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Site", "Basin type", "Sample count", "Mean DOC (mg/L)", "Stdev (± mg/L DOC)", "RSD (± %)", "Min. (mg/L)", "Median (mg/L)", "Max. (mg/L)"),
               digits = c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2),
               caption = "*Summary of DOC across the six LWSA research sites with each nested catchment classified by basin type.*")
```

\  

The relative standard deviation (RSD) in DOC observed at LeechHead was lower than that of the two headwater sites upstream, and median DOC observed at LeechHead was very near to the median for the headwaters sites. Overall, there was greater variance among headwater sites than there was within each headwater site. For the higher order rivers, the variance observed at each mainstem was comparable to the variance among the three mainstems. Results of Levene's test confirmed that variance in DOC concentrations was not homogeneous across the six sites of the LWSA (p-value = 8.2^-10^).[^4] 

To identify which pairs of sites had equal DOC variance Levene's test was applied to sample DOC results. Table \@ref(tab:LevenesDOC) classifies each site comparison by basin-type and summarizes resulting Levene's test p-values for each pair. Of the nine comparisons made among the six sites, all pairs with WestLeech (site 5) and/or Weeks (site 1) did not have homogeneous variance with any other sites, while all other combinations of sites showed homoscedasticity in DOC. Both of these heteroscedastic sub-basins drain the west side of LWSA. 

[^4]:Levene's test is used to check for homogeneity of variance (homoscedasticity), it's an alternative to the Bartlett’s test that's less sensitive to departures from normality in the data.

\  

```{r LevenesDOC}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/DOC-stats_variance-LeveneTests.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = c(5),
               caption = "*Results of Levene's test comparing DOC variance between pairs of sites. Significance stars indicate confidence levels: *** 99% (alpha = 0.01); ** 95% (alpha = 0.05); * 90% (alpha = 0.1), 90% confidence was the threshold for supporting the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity.*")
```

\  

#### Temporal trends in DOC: seasonality

Over the study period, DOC concentrations followed similar trends across each of the six LWSA sites (Figure \@ref(fig:DOCloess)). DOC was highest early in the wet season and progressively decreased through the fall and winter, reaching minimum concentrations in the spring before progressively increasing again through the summer. 

\  

```
{r DOCloess, out.width = "100%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:DOCloess} *Trends in dissolved organic carbon concentrations over sixteen months (Oct 2018 to Feb 2020) at six sites across the Leech water supply area (n = 323: 153 grab samples, 170 vertical rack samples.*"

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/DOC_trend_bassin-type-facet_loess.png")
```

\  

Overall, there was very little difference between mean DOC concentration through the wet season (6.2 ± 3 mg/L) compared to the dry season (5.5 ± 3 mg/L). However, there were far fewer samples collected in the dry season than during the wet season (Figure \@ref(fig:DOCseasonal).

\  

```
{r DOCseasonal, out.width = "100%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:DOCseasonal} *Boxplots of DOC concentrations at six LWSA sites during dry (n = 34) and wet (n = 90) seasons.*"

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/DOC_seasonal-subbasin_boxplots_2.png")
```


#####   Rising stage & DOM dynamics

The wet season was better represented than the dry by sample number and was therefore more interesting in terms of DOC concentration patterns. Additionally, the wet season is more relevant with respect to water supply because that is when flows are great enough to allow diversion for inter-basin transfer. High flows during the wet season also showed increased DOC concentrations relative to low flows; stormflow samples collected on vertical Racks showed higher DOC than Grab samples manually collected across wet seasons (Figure \@ref(fig:subbasinSampletypeBox). 

\  

```{r subbasinSampletypeBox, out.width = "100%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:subbasinSampletypeBox} *Wet-season dissolved organic carbon concentrations grouped by site and sample collection method, where Grab samples were manually obtained (n = 109) and Rack samples were collected passively on vertical racks fit with siphon sampler bottles (n = 170).*"

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/DOC_subbasin_GvsR_boxplot.png")
```

\  

A trend in DOC concentration during rising stage can provide information about NOM source and flux dynamics. Increasing DOC with rising stage suggests NOM transport dynamics were driven by hydrologic connectivity to an unlimited supply of source NOM. Alternatively, if DOC concentrations decrease with rising stage it's likely that the NOM source pool was limited (i.e., depletion of terrestrial allochthonous NOM supply)  [@Zarnetske2018]. While not every river response pulse was full sampled across, the vertical racks collected samples at progressively higher stage in each site. Figure \@ref(fig:RisingLimbPlot) shows DOC concentrations in rising limb sample across rain events. Generally, DOC increased with increasing river stage; however, the trend was not linear in each event response.

####   Spatiotemporal synchrony in local extrema: river stage and DOC

Streams responded harmoniously to precipitation across the LWSA, with synchronous changes in stage, but was a similar harmony present for fluctuations in DOC or spectral properties? Aqueous DOC was quantified from discrete river samples, and therefore the temporal synchrony of peaks could not be evaluated in the same manner as stage, which was continuously recorded. However, each river sample was matched to stage and had a corresponding time-stamp, therefore temporal synchrony in DOC could be inferred based on relationships between peak DOC and stage. To determine if local DOC extrema (maxima and minima concentrations) were captured in conjunction with the local extrema of sampled flows (minima and maxima of sampled stage), synchrony tests were run on sample results. For each site, results of samples were grouped by collection period and rain event to identify samples with extreme DOC concentrations as well as samples collected at extreme stage (max/min). Samples corresponding to maxima and minima DOC and stage were compared to determine how often they overlapped (i.e. was the sample with max DOC also the sample collected at the highest stage?). Table \@ref(tab:synchDOCstage) summarizes proportions of common DOC and stage extrema samples, where 1 indicates perfect agreement between samples of extreme DOC and sample-stage, and zero indicates complete asynchrony between DOC and stage highs and lows. 

\  

```{r synchDOCstage}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/synchrony_DOC-stage_extrema-simultaneous.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0,3,3),
               caption = "*Proportion of samples for which peak DOC was found in the highest sample stage.*")
```

\  

The majority of samples showed congruence between highs and lows of DOC with stage. West Leech was the only site which had a greater proportion of common maxima compared to minima, all other sites had more frequent occurrence of low DOC occurring at low stage that they did of high DOC occurring at high stage. Overall, each sites samples showed majority, but not absolute, agreement in extremes of DOC-stage relationships. Figure \@ref(fig:extremaplot) shows the extrema samples with stage at each site.

\

To better understand how timing of peak DOC varied among sites during the wet season, a subset of samples was selected for closer analysis (highlighted in Figure \@ref(fig:extremaplot) and expanded in Figure \@ref(fig:subsetExtremaplot)). The subset included samples from rain events 10-12; a subset deemed to be representative of DOC concentrations and rain events across the wet seasons, as there were no significant differences between DOC concentrations or rain events (amount and intensity) for this subset of samples compared to the rest of the study period (Table \@ref(tab:subbsetWilcox)). There were significant differences in UV~254~ absorbance for events 10-12 compared to the rest of the study period, therefore this subset was not considered representative of spectral trends overall and was only examined for DOC trends.
