### Introduction / synopsis

*__RQ.2.__   What are the primary drivers (e.g. watershed characteristics or conditions) for changes in DOC and NOM in the Leech watershed?

*__Objective 2:__   Relate water sample results to watershed characteristics and conditions to report on relationships between DOC, NOM and key variables, including differences between baseflow and storm events.

Chapter 4 showed decreasing DOC concentrations and aromaticity from headwaters to mouth of the Leech WSA

\  

...
intro section needs to lay out the problem you are trying to solve ie what are the drivers of DOC and NOM in the watershed and highlight some studies that have done this, and maybe the methods they have used.  
...

\  



#### Methods -- ? Random Forests

The pulse shunt concept (PSC) explains DOC transport with major hydrologic events and the river continuum concept (RCC) explains NOM character changes through a combination of watershed processes and characteristics, but how can the relative importance of these attributes be determined? Random Forests are a statistical tool for non-parametric regression, prediction, classification and assessment of variable importance [@Strobl2009].   

\  

A collection of decision trees is a Random Forest, which play an important role for both predictive modeling and inference purposes. The Breiman's Random Forests (RF) is a machine learning algorithm for practical applications, which is popular for its accuracy in real-world systems [@Tyralis2019; @Biau2016]. In RF, a set of predictor variables (features) are used to predict the outcome of another variable (the predictant) through supervised learning algorithms, grouped as either regression or classification, depending on whether the variables are quantitative (i.e. numeric) or qualitative [@Breiman2001; @Tyralis2019]. RF is useful for solving practical statistical problems with real-world data and has been widely published in hydrologic and water resource research in recent years [@Tyralis2019].

\  

The RF algorithm learns from many independent Classification And Regression Trees (CARTs) which undergo bootstrap-aggregating ("bagging") with randomization; meaning that no single tree includes all the data, which reduces over-fitting and improves prediction performance [@Breiman2001; @Tyralis2019; @Biau2016]. In RF, many decision trees are created, each one generated by randomly sampling from the full data set (with replacement) and each tree is trained until only one possible solution remains (i.e. leaf nodes contain one deciding variable). For problems of regression (i.e. quantitative numeric variables, such as the data in this thesis), the forest prediction is the average of the individual trees predictions [@Tyralis2019; @Biau2016]. The relative importance of each feature is determined by assessing the accuracy of how well the predictant variable is anticipated in the absence or presence of that feature. 

\  

The capability to evaluate variable importance metrics sets RF apart from other data-driven models that focus on prediction [@Tyralis2019]. Variable importance measure is a powerful part of Random Forests that evaluates the impact of each predictor variable on predicting a response variable; however, the variable importance measure shows bias towards correlated predictor variables [@Strobl2008]. 

\  

This chapter sets out to determine whether hydrological processes were the main driver for DOC and NOM dynamics and variation in the LWSA or if other watershed characteristics were more important for predicting DOC and NOM dynamics. The objective was to identify a mechanistic relationship between river stage and DOC or NOM by relating DOC concentrations and NOM character with stage (with attention to differences between baseflow and storm events). An additional objective was to assess the importance of watershed characteristics and conditions as explanatory variables for DOC and DOM patterns.

\  

### Methods

Six river locations in the Leech water supply area (Greater Victoria, BC) were set up as monitoring sites. Water samples were collected synoptically (standard grab sampling) and passively on the rising limb of the hydrograph via siphon samplers. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were quantified and molecular characteristics of natural organic matter (NOM) were evaluated with UV-Vis spectroscopy. Samples were related to river stage at each site, and relationships between stage and DOC/NOM were evaluated. Random Forests  [@Breiman2001] were used to determine the relative importance of watershed characteristics and conditions in determining DOC concentrations and NOM character across the six sites of the LWSA.   

\  


#### Monitoring sites and sub-basin characteristics

At each site, Vertical Racks were installed to measure continuous stage and collect water samples as the rivers rose in response to precipitation events. Nested catchments of the Leech River system included two headwater streams (Weeks and Chris Creek, sites 1 & 2), the head of Leech River below the confluence of the two headwater streams (site 3), two mainstem rivers that feed the Leech (Cragg Creek and West Leech, sites 4 & 5), and Leech Tunnel (site 6) encompassed the entire LWSA drainage area above the point of diversion (Figure \@ref(fig:subbasinMap)).	

\  

```{r subbasinMap, out.width = "50%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:subbasinMap} *Research sites in the Leech Water Supply Area. Sites are named and numbered, where the number indicates both the sequence of vertical rack installations as well as the relative progression from headwaters to mouth. Each research basin boundary (defined using each sampling site as the drainage outlet) is outlined in black, and the water supply area boundary is delineated in red.*"

knitr::include_graphics("R-inputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/images/thesis_map_subbasin-sampling_with-numbers.png")
```

\ 

Weeks Creek (site 1), had the greatest proportion of wetland and open water compared to the other sub-basins (Table \@ref(tab:WTScharacterSubbasinTable)). Chris Creek (site 2) and Cragg Creek (site 4) had no metasedimentary parent material (Argillite-Metagraywacke or Metagraywacke). Cragg Creek, draining from the east, was the only sub-basin with predominantly metamorphic parent material (Wark-Gneiss, 78%). West Leech (site 5) was the only sub-basin that did not have Wark-Gneiss nor Chert-Argillite-Volcanic groups as parent materials and was the only sub-basin of the Metchosin igneous complex (16% Methchosin-volcanics). Like Weeks basin (site 1), which also drains from the West, WestLeech is predominantly underlain by Argillite-Metagreywacke (metasedimentary parent material).

```

\ 

#### Random Forests for variable importance

The R package RandomForest was built on Breiman’s Random Forests (RF) algorithm. RandomForest was used to determine the relative importance of watershed characteristics and conditions in determining DOC concentrations and DOM character in across the six sites of the LWSA [@Breiman2001].

___from Emily's thesis:___
"To assess the relative importance of various predictors in the model, we calculated variable importance as
a percent contribution to sum of squared errors (SSE). This is done by algorithms in the randomForest
package by removing the predictors one at a time and measuring the increase in prediction error
(Breiman, 2001)."

\  

___EXPLAIN WHICH VARIBLES YOU USED AND WHY___

included: 
* antecedent 7 day (+14 day / 21 day / 28 day / 35 day?) temperature & rain
* what are key fire risk parameters -- is there a link between fire weather risk and inceased NOM or DOC?
* include event data (rain intensity, amount, duration)
* include antecedent rain amounts
* include antecedent snow also

\  

Watershed characteristics for each of the six monitoring sites (Figure \@ref(fig:subbasinMap), Table \@ref(tab:WTScharacterSubbasinTable)) were included with antecedent 7-day temperatures and antecedent 30-day rain, river stage and sampling season as possible predictor variables for DOC concentrations. Variable importance was assessed using the R package randomForest, the backbone of which is Breiman’s Random Forests (RF) algorithm [@Breiman2001]. 

\  

Parameters were filtered as much as possible to remove those that could cause spurious correlations (i.e. cross-correlated variables) and the RF variable importance measure (VIM) was evaluated for the entire study period (Figure \@ref(fig:RFplot)). 

Variables were subset into three variable groups: conditions (e.g. weather) which included dynamic numeric measurements; basin surface characteristics (e.g. land-cover) which included static watershed characteristics unique to each sampling basin; and parent material which included static subsurface characteristics of each sampling basin. Surface and subsurface characteristics were separated because... 

\  

#### evaluating local extrema

Aqueous DOC was quantified from discrete stream samples, and therefore the temporal synchrony of peaks could not be evaluated in the same manner as stage, which was continuously recorded. However, each river sample was matched to stage and had a corresponding time-stamp, therefore temporal synchrony in DOC could be inferred based on relationships between peak DOC and stage. To determine if local DOC extrema (maxima and minima concentrations) were captured in conjunction with the local extrema of sampled flows (minima and maxima of sampled stage), synchrony tests were run on sample results. For each site, results of samples were grouped by collection period and rain event to identify samples with extreme DOC concentrations as well as samples collected at extreme stage (max/min). Samples corresponding to maxima and minima DOC and stage were compared to determine how often they overlapped (i.e. was the sample with max DOC also the sample collected at the highest stage?).

\  


### Results

\  

...
Stream levels at each monitoring site were matched to the stage that Vertical Rack samples were collected to obtain date-time of sample collection, and the date-time of each Grab sample collection was matched to recorded stage (Figure \@ref(fig:seasonMegaplot)). 

\  
 
```{r seasonMegaplot, fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:seasonMegaplot} *Rain events, stream response, sample collection and seasons across the Leech Water Supply Area. Dashed vertical lines indicate the start of rain events, points indicate the timing and stage of river samples collected, and pink vertical lines delineate seasons.*"

```

\  

```{r EventsTable3}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/CH3_events-n-samples.csv") %>%  
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0,0,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2), 
               caption = "*Rain events defined by a threshold of 50mm with 14-hour inter-event period*",

```

\  

Eight of the 18 rain events were captured in the 2019 water year (2018-2019 wet season), the other ten in the 2020 water year. For each calender year in the study period, major rain events' minimum and maximum values of depth, duration and intensity were identified (Table \@ref(tab:MinMaxEvents)).   

\  

```{r MinMaxEvents}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/Wx_Events-annual_min-max.csv") %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0,1,1,1,1,2,1),
               caption = "*Minimum and maximum rain event values *")
```

\  

An intense atmospheric river event hit the LWSA January 29-31 (event 17, Table \@ref(tab:EventsTable3)) and generated incredible flows across the Leech watershed (and across southern Vancouver Island). Streamflow at CraggCrk (site 4) and the Tunnel (site 6) over-topped the 2 m vertical racks and ripped the level-loggers out of their stilling wells. Luckily, the level-loggers were found downstream in February and (after drying the circuit boards) the data were successfully retrieved from both Odyssey loggers. Following event 17, changes to the stream-bed morphology were evident at LeechHead (site 3) in the form of gravel and cobble deposition, there was evidence of substantial coarse woody debris transport at ChrisCrk (site 2), and destruction to hydrologic monitoring equipment at the Leech Tunnel.

\  

...

\  

#### Spatial patterns in DOC & NOM

Samples with maximum DOC concentrations were captured by vertical racks at five of the six sites, except for the head of Leech River (LeechHead, site 3) where peak DOC happened to be collected as a Grab sample (Table \@ref(tab:SixDOCsummarySampleType)).

\  

```{r SixDOCsummarySampleType}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/DOC-sixsite_summary_sample-type.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Site", "Sample type", "Sample count", "Mean DOC (mg/L)", "sd (± mg/L DOC)", "RSD (± %)", "Min. (mg/L)", "Median (mg/L)", "Max. (mg/L)"),
               digits = c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2),
               caption = "*Summary of DOC across the six LWSA installation sites including breakdown of sample type collected.*")
```

\  

Highest concentrations and variance in DOC occurred at the Weeks Main creek headwater site (Weeks, site 1), a sub-basin in the northwest of the Leech watershed which includes Weeks Lake and surrounding wetlands. Lowest average concentration and variance in DOC was recorded at Cragg Creek (CraggCrk, site 4), a mainstem river that drains the east sub-basin of the Leech watershed including Jarvis Lake and the western slopes of Survey Mountain. DOC concentration and variance at Leech River Tunnel (Tunnel, site 6) was somewhat between that at WestLeech and CraggCrk (Figure \@ref(fig:subbasinDOCbox)).

\  

```{r subbasinDOCbox, fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:subbasinDOCbox} *Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations across the Leech watershed over sixteen months, collected by standard grab sampling and on vertical racks (318 samples total).*"

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/Ch3_DOC_subbasin_boxplots.png")
```

\  

##### Seasonal patterns in DOC & NOM

DOC concentrations followed similar sinusoidal trends over time at each site, with amplitude of variation decreasing from upstream to downstream sites (Figure \@ref(fig:DOCloess)).     

```{r DOCloess, fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:DOCloess} *Trends in dissolved organic carbon concentrations over sixteen months (Oct 2018 to Feb 2020) at six sites across the Leech water supply area. Trend lines represents locally weighted smoothing ('loess' method of local polynomial regression).*"

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/DOC_trend_bassin-type-facet_loess.png")
```

\  

The wet season was better represented than the dry by sample number and was therefore more interesting in terms of DOC concentration patterns. Additionally, the wet season water quality is most relevant with respect to water supply because that is when flows are great enough to allow diversion for inter-basin transfer. High flows during the wet season also showed increased DOC concentrations relative to low flows; stormflow samples collected on vertical Racks showed higher DOC than Grab samples manually collected across wet seasons (Figure \@ref(fig:subbasinSampletypeBox). 

\  

```{r subbasinSampletypeBox, out.width = "100%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:subbasinSampletypeBox} *Wet-season dissolved organic carbon concentrations grouped by site and sample collection method, where Grab samples were manually obtained (n = 109) and Rack samples were collected passively on vertical racks fit with siphon sampler bottles (n = 170).*"

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/Ch3_subbasin_GvsR_WETseason-boxplot.png")
```

\  

```{r wetDOCtable}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/Ch3_DOC_wet-season_subbasin_MeanMinMax-SampleType.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0,0,0,1,0,0,2,2), 
               col.names = c("Site", 
                             "Sample type",
                             "Sample count",
                             "Mean DOC (mg/L)", "sd (± mg/L DOC)", "RSD (± %)", 
                             "Min. (mg/L)", "Max. (mg/L)"),
               caption = "*Wet-season dissolved organic carbon concentrations by sample collection method across six monitoring sites in the LWSA.*")

```

\  

More samples were collected over the wet seasons than during the dry season due to event-based sampling and the relatively longer wet season period compared to dry (Table \@ref(tab:seasonalsamples)). Despite seasonal sample count differences, interesting spatial differences emerged when sample results were grouped by season (Figure \@ref(fig:seasonalNOM)). 


___what was interesting???___

 

\  

```{r seasonalsamples}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/Ch3_NOM-seasonal-summary.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2), 
               col.names = c("Site", "season", "count", 
                             "mean DOC (mg/L)", "sd (±)",
                             "mean SAC~254~ (m^-1^)", "sd (±)", 
                             "mean SUVA~254~ (L mg^-1^ m^-1^)", "sd (±)",
                             "mean E~2~E~3~", "sd (±)"),
               caption = "*Seasonal comparison of sample results by monitoring site*")
```

\  

```{r seasonalNOM, fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:seasonalNOM} *Sample results over the dry and wet seasons for DOC (as NPOC, mg/L) concentrations and indicators of NOM aromaticity and molecular size: SAC~254~(m^-1^), SUVA (L mg^-1^ m^-1^), E~2~:E~3~.*"

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/Ch3_NOM-DOC_boxplots-by-season.png")
```

\  

The spectral indices indicated that, during the dry-season, Weeks (site 1) had much greater aromaticity compared to the other sites -- this may have been due to inputs from Weeks Lake and its surrounding wetlands. Aside from the highly aromatic character of NOM observed at Weeks in the dry months, E~2~:E~3~ suggests that aqueous NOM increased in aromaticity from upstream to downstream; while this quotient can also be indicative of molecular size (by an inverse relationship), the simultaneous decrease in DOC concentration indicates that molecular weight was not increasing downstream (Figure \@ref(fig:seasonalNOM)). SAC~254~ showed a similar increase in aromatic character from headwaters to mouth during the dry season, albeit the trend was less pronounced and there was a larger difference between ChrisCrk and LeechHead in SAC~254~ than in E~2~:E~3~. SUVA~254~, as could be expected, displayed a combination of DOC and SAC~254~ trends. DOC concentrations decreased from headwaters to mouth in both the wet and dry seasons, with the greatest variance at the head (Weeks) and mouth (Tunnel). 

\  

In the wet season, there was a spatial decrease in NOM aromaticity from headwaters to the Tunnel. In the headwater streams (sites 1 & 2), wet season NOM character was more aromatic at Weeks but had a broader range in spectral indices values at ChrisCrk. 

\  

#### Rising stage and NOM dynamics

Across the LWSA, fluctuations in river stage were temporally synchronized over the sixteen-month study period. Overall river responses among the six sites were confirmed to be congruent with high confidence (p-value < 0.001, based on 1050 randomizations) via Kendall's coefficient of concordance (Kendall's W = 0.9721) and Spearman's ranked correlation (ρ = 0.9666).

\  

```{r stageResponse}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/Ch3_response_stage-summary.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0,1,1,1,1,2,1), 
               col.names = c("site", 
                             "shortest time to peak stage (hr)", 
                             "longest time to peak stage (hr)", 
                             "smallest change in stage (cm)", 
                             "largest change in stage (cm)", 
                             "minimum rate of stage change (cm/hr)", 
                             "maximum rate of stage change (cm/hr)"),
               caption = "*Summary of stream response to precipitation events across the LWSA.*")
```

\  

Rates of change in stream response were calculated for each site to evaluate the fastest and slowest times to peak stage and relative magnitudes of change (Table \@ref(tab:stageResponse)). As expected, rate of change in stage was greatest at the Tunnel (site 6) and smallest at the Weeks headwater creek (site 1) which drains Weeks Lake and surrounding wetlands. 

\  

####   Spatiotemporal synchrony in local extrema: river stage and DOC



\  

Streams responded ___harmoniously___ to precipitation across the LWSA, with synchronous changes in stage, but was a similar harmony present for fluctuations in DOC or spectral properties? 


 Table \@ref(tab:synchDOCstage) summarizes proportions of common DOC and stage extrema samples, where 1 indicates perfect agreement between samples of extreme DOC and sample-stage, and zero indicates complete asynchrony between DOC and stage highs and lows. 

\  

```{r synchDOCstage}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/synchrony_DOC-stage_extrema-simultaneous.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0,3,3),
               caption = "*Proportion of samples for which peak DOC was found in the highest sample stage.*")
```

\  

Most samples showed congruence between highs and lows of DOC with stage. West Leech was the only site which had a greater proportion of common maxima compared to minima, all other sites had more frequent occurrence of low DOC occurring at low stage that they did of high DOC occurring at high stage. Overall, each site's samples showed majority, but not absolute, agreement in extremes of DOC-stage relationships (Figure \@ref(fig:extremaplot)).

\  

...

\ 

In general DOC concentations were lowest at the beginning of events and increased with a rise in stage.  Then identify instances where this was not the case and if you noticed dilution affects as the season progressed – you could just make a simple plot of stage vs DOC (ie x vs y plot) at each site and see how they group and see if this grouping changes through the season.

\  

...

\  

```{r extremaplot, out.width = "100%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:extremaplot} *Stage and samples collected, highlighting samples with maximum and minimum DOC concentrations for each rain event and collection period. Black vertical lines indicate a subset of samples that were assessed more closely.*"

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/extrema_peakDOC-stage_plot.png")
```

\  

Changes in DOC during events varied from a little more than 1% DOC change to nearly 100% change during event response (Table \@ref(tab:DOCResponse)).

\  

___This table provides some useful info.  I would tru to look at individual events and pull out interesting facts like during this event, DOC concentration tripled or doubled or etc.  And then maybe present mean differences among events:___

               col.names = c("site", "lowest DOC in stormflow (mg/L)", "highest DOC in stormflow (mg/L)", "smallest change in DOC (mg/L)", "largest change in DOC (mg/L)", "smallest difference in DOC during stormflow (%)", "largest difference in DOC during stormflow (%)"),
               caption = "Summary of DOC Changes Within Stormflow Response to Precipitation Events Across the Leech WSA (Samples from Wet Season Only).*")
```

\

#### River stage, DOC & NOM

In general, DOC concentrations increased with increasing stage across the LWSA, thought the patterns were not necessarily linear and not always consistent. The relationships between spectral indicators of NOM character and stage showed tighter patterns than DOC concentration with stage at all sites, but again the relationships were not linear (Figure \@ref(fig:stageRelations)). ...___I don’t actually see that pattern at all in those figures – not sure you can do hysteresis plots with the data you have, but you should try___....

fig_cap = "\\label{fig:stageRelations} *Relationships between river stage and sample DOC concentrations and NOM character. Data for each variable were normalized (min-max normalization) to clarify relative scales in each relationship. None of the relationships were were linear, some had more large variance and some variables remained consistent with changing stage.*"

### Remove until you fix this

___this section is a bit whacky -- needs attention to Fix___
To get a better idea of stream surge NOM dynamics, well sampled rising limb stream surges were examined...

Trip 4 // rain event 3 [for sites 1-5] 
Trip 5 // rain event 4 for Tunnel

* earlier 2019

To better understand how timing of peak DOC varied among sites during the wet season, a subset of samples was selected for closer analysis (highlighted in Figure \@ref(fig:extremaplot) and expanded in Figure \@ref(fig:subsetExtremaplot)). The subset included samples from rain events 10-12; a subset deemed to be representative of DOC concentrations and rain events across the wet seasons, as there were no significant differences between DOC concentrations or rain events (amount and intensity) for this subset of samples compared to the rest of the study period (Table \@ref(tab:subbsetWilcox)). There were significant differences in UV~254~ absorbance for events 10-12 compared to the rest of the study period, therefore this subset was not considered representative of spectral trends overall and was only examined for DOC trends.

### Discussion


Increasing DOC on the rising limb indicates that source material is not limited and flux is driven by hydrologic connectivity; whereas source limited conditions likely drive NOM dynamics if DOC concentration decreases on the rising limb [@Zarnetske2018]. Analysis of rack samples clarifies the magnitude and direction of water quality changes in response to precipitation relative, which provides information about solute supply and hydrologic connectivity [@Vidon2008; @Abbott2018; @Creed2015; @Zarnetske2018].

* variability among sub-basins versus variability within each sub-basin over time
* timing of peaks and valleys of stage -- at 10 min resolution was there a lag from upstream to downstream?
* source versus transport limitations -- DOC in rising limb
* any hysteretic behaviour? (DOC over time by event)
* was there a relationship between rain event intensity/duration and DOC?
* use RF to determine relative importance of watershed characteristics as DOC predictors
* use RF to in-fill missing NOM absorbance data based on relationship with DOC??? Like Yeonuk did for CH4 flux

A pattern in DOC concentration during rising stage can provide information about NOM source and flux dynamics. Increasing DOC with rising stage suggests NOM transport dynamics were driven by hydrologic connectivity to an unlimited supply of source NOM. Alternatively, if DOC concentrations decrease with rising stage it's likely that the NOM source pool was limited (i.e. depletion of terrestrial allochthonous NOM supply)  [@Zarnetske2018].

### Conculsions

* establishing connectivity among nested catchments as a baseline for experimental treatments (future)


Combining methods of vertical sampling racks with standard synoptic grab sampling provided useful time-stamped discrete river samples data that could be adapted and correlated to local rating curves to calculate loads of river material (e.g. nutrients, metals, organics, etc.) exported from monitored catchments. Material transport loads are important for management decisions and comprehensive system understanding. 

future:

* matched sample filling-stage with continuous logger stage could be combined with rating curve to determine mass transport or loading (future)
