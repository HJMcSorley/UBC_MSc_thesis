### Synopsis / Introduction

The previous chapter showed that across the Greater Victoria Water Supply Area (GVWSA), the character of natural organic matter (NOM) shifted from aliphatic in the dry season to aromatic during the wet seasons. Additionally, Chapter 3 results confirmed that event-based Rack samples had higher DOC concentrations than standard Grab samples. The seasonal character shift agreed with predictions of the river continuum concept (RCC), as did an observed spatial reduction in NOM molecular diversity from lower-order to higher-order streams [@Vannote1980; @Abbott2018; @Mosher2015; @Creed2015]. Elevated NOM in stormflow was expected (e.g. @Vidon2008; @Raymond2010) and is a key aspect of the pulse-shunt concept [@Raymond2016]. 

\  

Of the main tributaries to the Leech River mainstem, Cragg crk had the lowest average concentration and least aromatic NOM character, while West Leech NOM was higher in concentration and more aromatic. It was expected that that there would be differences in NOM concentration and character among monitoring sites, but it wasn’t immediately obvious why event-based NOM variances were greater at the West Leech site (20.85 km2 sub-basin) compared to other streams draining catchments of similar size (i.e. Leech-head, 20.59 km2 sub-basin; and Cragg crk 28.06 km2 sub-basin). As water quality is intrinsically linked to watershed characteristics, there may be a key feature (or combination of features) that operate in tandem with weather conditions to drive NOM concentration and character dynamics. This chapter evaluates watershed characteristics (e.g. land cover, parent material, slope) with conditions (e.g. antecedent rain, sampling stage) to identify possible explanatory variables for differences and drivers of change in NOM concentration and character across the six sub-basins
monitoring sites in the Leech WSA.

\  

#### Random Forests

\  

A Random Forest is a collection of decision trees, which composes a statistical tool for non-parametric regression, prediction, classification and assessment of variable importance [@Strobl2009]. Breiman's Random Forests (RF) is a machine learning algorithm for practical applications, which is popular for its accuracy in real-world systems [@Tyralis2019; @Biau2016] and does not require independence among samples (good news for analysis of nested catchments). RF has been widely published in hydrologic and water resource research in recent years, particularly in streamflow and water quality studies [see @Tyralis2019 and references therein]. In RF, a set of predictor variables (features) are used to predict the outcome of another variable (the predictant) through supervised learning algorithms which are grouped as either regression or classification, depending on whether the variables are quantitative (i.e. numeric) or qualitative [@Breiman2001; @Tyralis2019]. 

\  

The RF algorithm learns from many independent Classification And Regression Trees which undergo bootstrap-aggregating ("bagging") with randomization; meaning that no single tree includes all the data, which reduces over-fitting and improves prediction performance [@Breiman2001; @Tyralis2019; @Biau2016]. In RF, many decision trees are created, each one generated by randomly sampling from the full data set (with replacement) and each tree is trained until only one possible solution remains (i.e. leaf nodes contain one deciding variable). For problems of regression (i.e. quantitative numeric variables, such as the data in this thesis), the final forest prediction is equal to the average of individual tree predictions [@Tyralis2019; @Biau2016]. 

\  

The capacity to evaluate variable importance metrics sets RF apart from other data-driven models that focus on prediction [@Tyralis2019]. The relative importance of each feature can be determined by assessing the accuracy of how well the response variable (predictant) is anticipated in the absence or presence of each predictor feature. Through the RF algorithm, VIM is assessed by removing predictor variables one at a time and measuring the decrease in prediction accuracy in their absence [@Breiman2001]. This is achieved based on either the increase in mean square error (MSE) or the increase in sum of square errors (SSE). The SSE method may be more appropriate for categorical variables than quantitative variables, for which MSE method appears to be more appropriate. 
...
Type 1 of the variable importance measure (VIM) is calculated by permutation, where "the prediction error on the out-of-bag portion of the data is recorded (error rate for classification, MSE for regression). Then the same is done after permuting each predictor variable. The difference between the two are then averaged over all trees, and normalized by the standard deviation of the differences" [@Liaw2018]. VIM type 2 "is the total decrease in node impurities from splitting on the variable, averaged over all trees. For classification, the node impurity is measured by the Gini index. For regression, it is measured by residual sum of squares" [@Liaw2018].
...
Despite the ability of RF to handle non-independent real world data, mixing categorical and quantitative data has shown bias towards variables with many categories, many missing values, and strong cross-correlations among predictor variables [@Strobl2008]. Therefore, some predictor refinement is important. 

\  

#### Hysteresis

_update this because it's alluding to C-Q and you don't have Q_

Storm events are understood to be a key driver for solute and particle mobilization in streams (e.g. @Aguilera2018; ...). Material transport (be it in solution or suspension) tends to show a non-linear relationship to discharge, in that concentrations do not necessarily peak in congruence with flow. This hysteretic behaviour, where the relationship between concentration and discharge is different on the rising limb versus the falling limb of the hydrograph, creates a hysteresis loop that can reveal information about origins and transport of aquatic material, relative to the point of measurement [@Vaughan2019; @Evans1998; @Aguilera2018]. Concentration-discharge hysteresis may be due to episodic flushing of material or from component mixing processes [@Evans1998]. Information about flow-paths and source pools can be obtained from four elements of the C-Q relationship plot: the shape (linear, circular, figure-eight), the direction of a hysteresis loop, the magnitude, and the direction of slope [@Aguilera2018].    

\  

Concentration-discharge relationships  (C-Q) can elucidate flow-paths and aid in estimating proportional streamflow contributions (i.e. subsurface vs overland, or near-stream vs. upland) [@Evans1999]. C-Q can be used to determine whether a catchment's solute export regime is chemostatic or chemodynamic [@Musolff2015]. In an assessment of ~400 stream events in coastal California, Aguilera and Melack [-@Aguilera2018] found that sediment-associated concentrations peaked during high flows but dissolved nitrogen species concentrations had hysteretic behaviour with flow, the direction of which differed depending on land-use. 

\  

Dominant sources and flow paths during events can be inferred from the slope (positive or negative) and the direction of the hysteresis loop rotation [@Evans1998; @Aguilera2018]. A clockwise C-Q hysteresis loop indicates rapid flushing and dilution (higher concentration on the rising limb than falling limb) while a counter-clockwise loop indicates enrichment via delayed material delivery from distant (upstream) or deeper subsurface source pools [@Aguilera2018]. Evans et al. [-@Evans1999] determined that C-Q analysis requires a minimum of five samples to determine the rotational direction of hysteresis: pre and post episode low-flow, rising and falling limbs and near to peak Q. 

\  

Using end-member mixing, with hydrometric monitoring and carbon isotope (δ^13^C~DOC~) data, Lambert et al. [-@Lambert2014] determined that approximately 80% of stream DOC flowed through the riparian domain's most superficial soil horizons, and that riparian soil DOC was sourced from both riparian and upland areas. Upland NOM source pools were determined to contribute significant amounts of carbon to streams, but were supply-limited; whereas riparian NOM was found to be a near-finite carbon source. Lambert et al. [-@Lambert2014] also found that upland sources contributed most early in the wet season (~30% of stream DOC) and less as high-flows continued (decreased to ~10% of stream DOC later in the wet period). In that vein, antecedent weather conditions are important for nutrient and sediment export and C-Q relationships, as the first precipitation events after a prolonged dry period can result in rapid flushing of accumulated material [@Aguilera2018].

### Methods 

\  

#### Site details

This chapter focuses on the six Leech WSA monitoring sites (Figure \@ref(fig:subbasinMap)), which were equipped with Vertical Rack samplers. Nested catchments of the Leech WSA included two headwater streams, Weeks and Chris crk sub-basins (site 1, 11.5 km^2^  & site 2 , 5.9 km^2^); the head of Leech River ('Leech-head'), below the confluence of those two headwater streams (site 3, 20.6 km^2^ sub-basin); two major tributaries that feed the Leech, Cragg crk and West Leech sub-basins (site 4, 28.1 km^2^ & site 5, 20.9 km^2^), and Leech Tunnel (site 6) which encompassed drainage of the entire Leech WSA above the point of diversion (95.3 km^2^). Sample collection and analysis follow the methods detailed in Chapter 2. Of the main tributaries to the Leech River mainstem, Cragg crk had the lowest average concentration and least aromatic NOM character, while West Leech NOM was higher in concentration and more aromatic (Chapter 3).

```

\ 

Surficial materials and soils in the Leech WSA were predominantly podzolic with approximately 50% of the parent material in each sub-basin composed of colluvial deposits with O-HFP development (orthic humo-ferric podzol). The second most dominant parent material for soil was till (morainal) with duric humo-ferric podzol (DU-HFP) soil development in all sub-basins except for West Leech, which had till-based O-HFP soils [@SoilsCanada2018]. DU-HFP differs from O-HFP by the presence of a strongly cemented layer (duric horizon) that is unlike the B horizon in O-HFP [@SoilScience2020]. Both DU-HFP and O-HFP are well drained, or moderately so, and O-HFP tends to be acidic (pH < 5.6) while DU-HFP is generally moderately acidic to neutral (pH 5.6 - 7.4) [@SoilsCanada2018]. There was a small amount of poorly drained terric mesisol (T.M., undifferentiated organic soil) present only in the Weeks crk sub-basin (Table \@ref(tab:WTScharacterSubbasinTable)). 

\ 

There were a few notable differences in subsurface geology between sub-basins (Table \@ref(tab:WTScharacterSubbasinTable)). West Leech was characterized by the absence of wark-gneiss and chert-argillite-volcanic parent materials (0%), which were present in all other sub-basins. Both Weeks crk and West Leech sub-basins were dominated by argillite-metagreywacke parent material (64% and 77%, respectively). West Leech was also underlain by metagreywacke (7%) and Metchosin volcanics (16%), which were absent in each of the other monitoring sub-basins. Cragg crk sub-basin (site 4) was underlain predominantly by metamorphic wark gneiss (78%) with no argillite-metagreywacke parent material (0%). Metagreywacke parent materials are part of the metasedimentary Leech River Formation, where metagreywacke is meta-sandstone and argillite-metagreywacke is more of a meta-mudstone. The Leech River Formation tends to be more erodible than wark-gneiss [@Ussery2015]. Chris crk and Cragg crk sub-basins had no metasedimentary parent material of the Leech River Formation.

\  

At the surface, Weeks crk sub-basin had the greatest proportion of wetland and open water compared to the other sub-basin sites (Table \@ref(tab:WTScharacterSubbasinTable)). Cragg crk sub-basin had the oldest average tree age (59 years). By area, the most heavily harvested basin since 1980 was the Chris crk sub-basin (63% harvested), then Leech-head and Cragg crk sub-basins (43% and 41% harvested, respectively). West Leech was the least harvested between 1980 and 2011 (26%), followed by Weeks crk sub-basin (28% harvested, but is also 7% open water and wetland), followed by the entire Leech Tunnel catchment area (34%).

```

\ 

The watershed characteristics included in Table \@ref(tab:WTScharacterSubbasinTable) were combined with Leech WSA weather data (Chapter 2) and sample results (Chapter 3) to identify possible explanatory variables that were driving changes in NOM concentration and character across the Leech WSA. Watershed characteristics and conditions were evaluated as possible predictors for NOM change using Random Forest algorithms. 

\  

#### Random Forests predictor variable refinement & quality control

RF variable importance measures (VIMs) were used to assess the relative importance of sub-basin characteristics and conditions as predictors of NOM concentration and character. VIM was assessed via the MSE method. Possible predictor variables for NOM concentration (i.e. DOC) and character (i.e. SAC~254~ and E~2~:E~3~) included sub-basin characteristics of each of the six monitoring sites (Table \@ref(tab:WTScharacterSubbasinTable)) as well as sampling stage and antecedent weather conditions. To avoid undue bias [@Strobl2008] all predictor variables were numeric values (quantitative) and missing values were removed. As cross-correlated predictors can cause biased VIM in RF, variables with correlation coefficients greater than 0.65 were omitted (though there is no standard definition for levels of correlation coefficient strengths, 0.65 seemed a reasonable threshold to separate moderate and more strongly correlated variables). 

\  

Values for median basin slopes were the same across three sites, so mean slopes were selected instead, as means were unique to each sampling basin. Sub-basin percent wetland cover was correlated with slope (-0.73), as well as forest cover (-0.97). Thus, wetland and forest percent cover were not included in VIM assessments, and slope was. Interestingly, the percent of sub-basins underlain by the meta-sedimentary Leech River formation (including argillite-metagreywacke (mudstone) and metagreywacke (meta-sandstone)) was correlated (-0.83) with 30-year logging history (percent of basin harvested 1980-2011). The Leech River geologic formation underlies the Weeks crk and West Leech sub-basins, which were also the two sub-basins least harvested since 1980 (Table \@ref(tab:WTScharacterSubbasinTable)). These are the types of correlations that could cause spurious VIM bias in RF, because it's unlikely that the presence of meta-sedimentary parent material was the cause for these basins to be less harvested. Parent-material variables were refined to metamorphic (wark-gneiss) and igneous (Metchosin volcanics & gabbro stocks), which did not show cross-correlation to other predictor variables. As one might expect, soil materials were correlated with geologic parent materials (as well as with each other and logging history), thus soils were not included with RF VIM predictor variables.  

\  

The nine selected predictor variables for RF VIM assessment included:

* metamorphic parent-material (wark gneiss, percent of basin)
* igneous parent material (Metchosin volcanics & gabbro stocks, percent of basin)
* drainage area (km^2^) 
* mean basin slope (degrees)
* tree age (average, years)
* logging history (percent of basin harvested 1980-2011)
* antecedent 7-day air temperatures (°C, mean) 
* antecedent 30-day rain (mm, total)
* sampling stage (normalized)  

\  

Sampling stages for each site were scaled (min-max-normalized) to account for differences between Vertical Rack installations and to allow for comparison between sites (example calculation in Appendix _XXXX_). For antecedent rain and air temperatures, different periods of time were considered in exploratory data analysis. Intervals of 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 30 days prior to sample collection were evaluated for cross-correlations and relative VIM results. The intervals of 30 days for antecedent rain and 7 days for antecedent air temperature were chosen because (1) they were not cross correlated with other predictor variables or each other and (2) each was more easily distinguished in VIM results than other interval options. 

\  

Furthermore, 30 days of rain could be considered as an indicator of overall antecedent landscape wetness, whereas shorter periods of rain may not have been adequate indicators of wetness due to interception, evaporation, or evapotranspiration losses. A longer period of antecedent rain may be indicative of greater connectivity of streams to distant/deeper terrestrial environments. Using the same VIM parameters tuned for DOC prediction, 30-day antecedent rain was relatively more important than 7-day rain (15.3% vs. 12.8%) for predicting E~2~:E~3~, and 7-day antecedent air temperatures were more important than 30-day air temperatures (8.5% vs. 6.5%). This confirmed that relatively short-term temperatures (rolling 7-day mean)and relatively long-term rain (rolling 30-day sum) were appropriate selections for RF VIM assessments.

\  

Surface and subsurface watershed characteristics were static values (e.g. basin slope, parent material), whereas sampling stage and antecedent weather were dynamic values (different for each sample). It was possible that RF might treat static values categorically, and RF bias can result from VIM assessment of combined categorical and numeric predictor variables. So, sub-basin characteristics and conditions were evaluated independently as well as together to see if there was a shift in overall relative VIM ranking results.  

\  

RF is a black box; for that reason, a variable of random numbers was included in the VIM assessment as a mode of quality assurance (QA). VIM assessment, with the QA variable, was completed for watershed characteristics and conditions to ensure that random numbers were not assigned any predictor importance. The QA variable was removed from final assessment and is not displayed in results (below). Following RF VIM analysis, the variables with relatively greatest predictor importance were further explored by evaluating their one-on-one relationships with NOM concentration and character. Results of RF VIM assessment were also used to retrospectively infer importance of variables that were excluded from VIM due to their cross correlation(s). Where possible, important predictor variables were assessed for hysteretic behaviour. 

\  

#### Hysteresis

Hydrochemical hysteresis is most often evaluated through C-Q relationships, but the concept of hysteresis applies to any time-based predictor and effected values. The principle of hysteresis is based on a lag between a driving force (e.g. discharge, Q) and the analyte that is driven to change (e.g. solute concentration, C). Ideally, streamflow data would accompany all sample data collected for this research, however that was not the case. Stage data was collected, and given the strong relationship between stage and discharge, stage can be evaluated as an indicator for Q. Similarly, because streamflow in the Leech WSA is governed by precipitation, rain and antecedent wetness could be proxy data in a hysteresis analysis. Conditions that were calculated to be most important for predicting NOM concentration and character were plotted with their predictant to assess possible hysteresis. This was only possible for dynamic conditions with variable measurements (i.e. not static watershed characteristics predictors).

\  

For a C-Q hysteresis loop, clockwise rotation indicates rapid flushing and dilution, while counter-clockwise rotation indicates enrichment via delayed material delivery from distant (upstream) or deeper subsurface source pools [@Aguilera2018]. Because of the assumed relationship between antecedent rain and streamflow, a similar interpretation was used here despite the absence of discharge data.  

\  

#### Evaluating local extrema

Results in the previous chapter showed elevated NOM in event-based samples, to explore that relationship more deeply a peak-to-peak comparison was done to see if DOC peaked with stream stage. As DOC was quantified from discrete stream samples the temporal synchrony of peaks could not be evaluated in the same manner as stage, which was continuously recorded. However, each river sample was matched to stage and had a corresponding timestamp, thus inferences could be made based on relationships between peak DOC and stage. To determine if local DOC extrema (maxima and minima concentrations) were captured in conjunction with the local extrema of sampled flows (minima and maxima of sample stage), manual synchrony tests were run on sample results. For each site, results of samples were grouped by collection period and rain event to identify samples with extreme DOC concentrations as well as samples collected at extreme stage (max/min). Samples corresponding to maxima and minima DOC and stage were compared to determine how often they overlapped (i.e. was the sample with max DOC also the sample collected at the highest stage?).

\  


### Results 

\  

#### Random Forest variable importance

A variable of random numbers was included with watershed characteristic and sampling condition predictors as a method of quality assurance (QA) in using the variable importance measure (VIM). Random numbers are not a real predictor of NOM concentration or character, so the VIM assessment should rank that QA variable as the least important predictor and assign it negligible importance. There are two methods for evaluating variable importance in randomForest (RF): type 1 measures the mean decrease in accuracy and type 2 measures the decrease in node impurity [@Liaw2018]. For the Leech WSA data, both VIM methods were checked and type 2 (total decrease in node impurities from splitting on the variable) assigned the random number variable relatively high importance (ranked more important than a real variable) while type 1 (permutation on out-of-bag data) ranked the random number variable as least important with insignificant weight [@Liaw2018]. These results clarified that type 1 VIM was the best choice and suggests that numeric data is best assessed for VIM by mean decrease in accuracy rather than mean decrease in node impurity.

\  

In VIM assessment of predictors, bias can result from combining categorical and numeric predictor variables. Although all RF data was numeric (e.g. percent of drainage basin by area, normalized stage, etc.) it was possible that RF could treat dynamic condition variables differently than static watershed characteristic variables, so sub-basin characteristics and conditions were evaluated independently as well as together to see if there was a shift in overall relative VIM ranking results. While it was expected that the relative importance (as a percent) would shift when all predictants were combined, it was not expected that the relative ranking would change -- but it did. When conditions and characteristics were combined for RF VIM, the relative ranking of each predictant was changed compared to when conditions and characteristics were analyzed separately (see Appendix _XXXX_, Figure \@ref(fig:RFallvars), for plots of combined predictors). These results suggest that static and dynamic predictor variables should be separated for RF VIM, as was done here. Perhaps dynamic variables (that changed with the predictant) were treated for regression while static variables were treated categorically. Here, VIM results are presented for the three predictants (DOC, SAC~254~, E~2~:E~3~) with conditions and characteristics grouped separately. 

\  

RF can sometimes find biased VIM if predictor variables are cross-correlated, and rain and stage were correlated (0.61 Pearson correlation coefficient), so RF VIM was run with only sampling stage, and with only antecedent 30-day rain and in both scenarios, each variable ranked at the same relative importance for predicting DOC.

\  

##### DOC: concentration

Across the Leech WSA monitoring sites, the condition with greatest influence on NOM concentration (DOC) was found to be sampling stage, followed by antecedent 7-day air temperature and then antecedent wetness (30-day rain). The top three watershed characteristic predictors for NOM concentrations were slope, percent of the basin underlain by metamorphic parent material and average tree age (Figure \@ref(fig:RFplotDOC)).

fig_cap = "\\label{fig:RFplotDOC} Variable importance for predicting NOM concentration (DOC) across six stream monitoring sites in the Leech River watershed.

```

\  

##### SAC~254~: reactivity & aromaticity

Like concentration, SAC~254~ was best predicted by sampling stage. Unlike DOC, SAC~254~ was relatively more sensitive to antecedent rain than air temperatures. The top three watershed characteristic predictors for NOM aromaticity and reactivity (SAC~254~) were percent of the basin underlain by metamorphic parent material (wark gneiss), slope, and the importance of drainage area was nearly tied with that of 30-year logging history (Figure \@ref(fig:RFplotSAC254)).

```

\  

##### E~2~:E~3~: molecular size & aromaticity

The VIM ranking for sampling conditions for E~2~:E~3~ were the reverse of those for DOC. NOM molecular size and aromaticity (E~2~:E~3~) was best predicted by antecedent 30-day rain, followed by 7-day air temperatures and then sampling stage. 

The top three watershed characteristic predictors for NOM aromaticity and reactivity (SAC~254~) were percent of the basin logged from 1980-2011, followed by percent underlain by metamorphic parent material (wark gneiss) which was nearly tied with average tree age (Figure \@ref(fig:RFplotSAC254)).

```

\  

#### Predictors in relation to NOM concentration and character 

When all variables were assessed together, sampling conditions were more important than Watershed characteristics for predicting NOM concentration and character across the Leech WSA monitoring sites (Appendix, Figure \@ref(fig:RFallvars)). 

\  

##### Sampling conditions

The ranking of relative importance for sampling conditions were in reverse order for DOC (stage, temp, rain) and E~2~:E~3~ (rain, temp, stage). Like DOC, SAC~254~ was similarly influence most by sampling stage; and like E~2~:E~3~, SAC~254~ was more sensitive to antecedent wetness than antecedent air temperatures. The relative sensitivity of NOM concentration to stream stage points to hydrologic mass transport, whereas the sensitivity to antecedent wetness points to the importance of hydrologic connectivity between the terrestrial landscape and stream system for NOM molecular character. 

\  

###### Sampling stage

Stream stage at the time of sample collection was the most important condition predictor variable for DOC and SAC~254~. Concentration of DOC increased with increasing stage up to approximately 60% of maximum sampling stage at each site. The same relationship was seen (albeit more dramatically) for SAC~254~ (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMstage)). This indicates that as stream levels increased, so too did NOM concentration and aromaticity. This was expected based on results in Chapter 3 that showed higher concentrations of more aromatic NOM in Vertical Rack samples compared to (inter-event) Grab samples. The threshold level (~0.6 of peak stage) points to a change where increasing stage led to dilution rather than mobilization.

\  

Stream stage was the least important sampling condition for predicting E~2~:E~3~ (below antecedent rain and air temperature), and the two variables were inversely related. This pattern supports results of stage in relation to SAC~254~ and shows that as stream stage increased across the Leech WSA, so too did NOM molecular size & aromaticity. Like SAC~254~, E~2~:E~3~ and stage had a weaker relationship around 60-75% of maximum stage (indicated by the greater uncertainty in the loess trend line, Figure \@ref(fig:VIMstage)) which indicates a point at which aromaticity no longer increased with stage. While there were fewer high-flow samples collected compared to mid-range and low-flow samples, this apparent sampling stage threshold may indicate depletion of a terrestrial NOM aromatic pool, or could suggest that the most aromatic sources had reached peak connectivity to the streams and NOM could get no more humic in nature.

```

\  

###### Antecedent 7-day air temperature

Antecedent 7-day mean air temperature (mean air temperature for the 7-day period prior to sample collection) ranked second most important for predicting DOC and E~2~:E~3~ and was the least important (third) sampling condition for predicting SAC~254~. The concentration, reactivity, aromaticity and molecular weight of NOM increased with antecedent air temperature up to approximately 10°C (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMtemp)). DOC and 7-day temperature were positively related in the wet season with no obvious relationship in the dry season (Appendix _XXX_, Figure \@ref(fig:RFtempDOC)) and too few spectral samples were collected in the dry season to shed light on seasonal trends in NOM character with antecedent temperatures.

```


\  

###### Antecedent 30-day rain

Antecedent 30-day cumulative rain (i.e. antecedent wetness) was the sampling condition calculated to have the greatest relative importance in predicting E~2~:E~3~, second-most importance for SAC~254~ and was the least important sampling condition for predicting DOC concentration. As antecedent 30-day rain increased to approximately 150 mm, there was an apparent decrease in NOM aromaticity and molecular size (E~2~:E~3~ increased); above ~150 mm, NOM aromaticity and molecular size increased. At approximately 300 mm of 30-day antecedent rain, NOM aromaticity and molecular size appeared to become less variable (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMrain)). 

\  

Fewer sample results existed for SAC~254~, with a data gap for samples collected between 200 mm and 400 mm of 30-day antecedent rain; therefore, the pattern of SAC~254~ and antecedent wetness was less precise (large uncertainty, Figure \@ref(fig:VIMrain)). For the available data, rain accumulation in the 30 days prior to sample collection was positively related to SAC~254~ up to approximately 150 mm and SAC~254~ was relatively low with antecedent 30-day rain above 400 mm. Though the relationship was non-linear, there was a slight initial increase in DOC with increasing antecedent wetness, followed by a gradual decline in DOC with increasing accumulated rain (Figure 18). Lower order streams (Weeks, Chris, Leech-head) showed a steeper decline in DOC with increasing 30-day antecedent rain (site-specific plot in Appendix _XXXXX_, Figure \@ref(fig:VIMrainSites)). 

\  

Together, these patterns of antecedent wetness with DOC and E~2~:E~3~ suggest that smaller, more aliphatic NOM was flushed through the Leech system when antecedent wetness was low (i.e. near the onset of the wet season). As rains continued, streams had greater connection to more aromatic NOM source pools (humic material, possibly from upland sources). The slight decline in aromatic DOC with antecedent wetness (above approximately 350 mm in 30 days) suggests exhaustion of humic NOM source pools and a shift to dilution. These results largely support seasonal characteristic shifts described in Chapter 3, which follow prediction of the River Continuum Concept.

\  

##### Watershed characteristics

Of watershed characteristics, the top predictors for NOM concentration and character were a combination of mean sub-basin slope, metamorphic parent material (percent of basin), tree age (average), logging history (percent of basin harvested 1980-2011) and/or drainage area. 

\  

###### Sub-basin slope

Sub-basin slope ranked most important as a predictor for DOC and SAC~254~. Across the six monitoring sites, the relationship between slope and these two variables  was not linear and an interesting pattern appeared, where the six monitoring basins were grouped in pairs with two sites each between mean slopes of 9°- 10°, 10°- 11° and 11°- 12°. Within these pairs, the basin with lower slope had slightly greater NOM aromaticity, reactivity and concentration. In general, lower sub-basin slope was related to higher DOC (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMslope)). Slope was negatively correlated to percent wetland (-0.73), and wetlands are known to be linked with high DOC concentrations and greater NOM aromaticity. Indeed, SAC~254~ indicated higher aromaticity in sub-basins with lower mean slope (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMslope)). While slope was not ranked as a strong predictor for E~2~:E~3~, the relationship between the two largely agreed with results for SAC~254~.

\  

```{r VIMslope, fig.cap = fig_cap}

fig_cap = "\\label{fig:VIMslope} Sub-basin mean slope as a predictor for NOM concentration (DOC) and character (SAC~254~ & E~2~:E~3~) across six monitoring sites in the Leech watershed."

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/Ch4_RF_slope.png")
```

\ 

###### Parent material (metamorphic wark gneiss)

Metamorphic parent material (wark gneiss) was inversely correlated (-0.92) to the metasedimentary Leech River Formation. The percent of wark gneiss in each sub-basin was ranked as the second most important watershed characteristic for predicting each of DOC, SAC~254~ and E~2~:E~3~.
 
\  

For the five sites that were underlain by some proportion of wark gneiss, stream DOC concentrations decreased with increasing percentage of this metamorphic surficial deposit. While more metamorphic material corresponded to lower DOC, the absence of wark gneiss in West Leech sub-basin did not correspond to the highest DOC concentration (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMwark)). NOM character had a similar pattern to concentration, where greater metamorphic parent material corresponded to lower NOM aromaticity and reactivity (SAC~254~), but its absence did not correspond to the sub-basin with the lowest SAC~254~ (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMwark)). E~2~:E~3~ showed that greater metamorphic parent material corresponded to lower NOM aromaticity and molecular weight (higher E~2~:E~3~ values) and, in contrast to DOC and SAC~254~, the sub-basin with the greatest molecular weight NOM (lowest mean E~2~:E~3~) did correspond with the absence of wark gneiss (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMwark)).

\  

```{r VIMwark, fig.cap = fig_cap}

fig_cap = "\\label{fig:VIMwark} Percent of each sub-basin underlain by wark gneiss (metamorphic parent material) as a predictor for NOM concentration (DOC) and character (SAC~254~ & E~2~:E~3~) across six monitoring sites in the Leech watershed."

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/Ch4_RF_metamorphic.png")
```

\  

###### Logging history and mean tree age 

Of watershed characteristic variables, logging history (percent of basin harvested from 1980-2011) was ranked second for predicting E~2~:E~3~ and fourth for predicting SAC~254~. Average tree age was third in variable importance for predicting E~2~:E~3~ and fourth for DOC. These two predictor variables were examined together because average tree age was partially due to the history of forest harvest.

\  

Sub-basin area harvested between 1980 and 2011 was positively related to E~2~:E~3~ at four of the six sub-basin sites. West Leech, Weeks, Leech Tunnel, and Cragg crk sub-basins showed decreasing NOM molecular weight and aromaticity (increasing E~2~:E~3~) with increasing area harvested. However, the sub-basins of Chris crk and Leech-head (just downstream) had higher harvested area (ergo younger trees) and did not match this pattern of less aromatic, lower molecular weight NOM with greater harvest history (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMloggingtree)). The sites with more aromatic and higher molecular weight NOM were not clearly linked to average tree age (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMloggingtree)).

\  

Chris crk and Cragg crk sub-basins had the youngest and oldest trees, respectively; yet, these two sites had very similar averages for NOM concentration and character, though Chris crk had slightly higher molecular weight NOM. While Cragg crk sub-basin had, on average, the oldest trees (likely due to old growth maintained on Horton Ridge) it was West Leech that was the least-harvested sub-basin of the six monitoring sites. Cragg crk and West Leech had similar mean DOC and SAC~254~ values but mean E~2~:E~3~ was different (___statistically??___); Cragg crk had greater molecular weight NOM than West Leech (but there error bars overlapped entirely).

* it's also possible that the GIS layers for forest harvest and tree age were missing some details 


what was the correlation when all variables combined??

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/Ch4_RF_logging-tree-age.png")
```

\  

###### Drainage area

Sub-basin drainage area was ranked third for predicting DOC and SAC~254~, and fourth in variable importance for E~2~:E~3~. The relationships between drainage area and NOM concentartion and character were examined and no patterns were evident (Figure \@ref(fig:VIMarea)).

\  

```{r VIMarea, fig.cap = fig_cap}

```

\  

  
##### Variable importance Summary

Of the watershed characteristics examined, the percent of each basin with metamorphic wark gneiss parent material appeared to be the most relevant and was a common predictor variable to each of DOC, SAC~254~ and E~2~:E~3~. The absence of wark gneiss was not related to the site with highest DOC, despite DOC decreasing with increasing metamorphic representation. Because subsurface material was largely cross-correlated, the observed patterns with wark gneiss may point to more nuanced relationships. NOM concentration and character could be influenced by other parent materials, or combinations of parent materials, that couldn't be teased out in this RF analysis because of cross-correlations with other predictor variables. It could be that what is observed as a negative relationship with wark gneiss is actually a positive relationship between DOC and another parent material, likely the schist-like Leech River Formation. 

\ 

Across the Leech WSA, warm conditions during the wet season were an important driver for DOC concentrations. Antecedent rain was positively related to DOC concentrations up to a 30-day accumulation of approximately 150 mm, at which point DOC concentrations declined with increasing antecedent wetness. This suggested a possible threshold at which dilution overtook NOM transport. Like concentration, NOM character was driven by antecedent wetness but only up to a threshold of approximately 150 mm of 30-day antecedent rain. After this threshold, the relationship was no longer positive. In a similar way, NOM aromaticity increased with increasing sample collection stage up to approximately 60-75% of maximum stage at each site.

\  

#### Warm and wet: seasonal patterns and rain event

Moisture and temperature, important to each of the three predictant variables, corresponded to different seasons. Given the evidence of strong seasonality for NOM character (Chapter 3), a comparison between the wet and dry season sample results was used to assess spatial difference between seasons for DOC, SAC~254~ and E~2~:E~3~. 

\  

During the dry-season, SAC~254~ and E~2~:E~3~ indicated that Weeks crk had greater aromaticity compared to the other sites. Aside from the highly aromatic character of NOM observed at Weeks, E~2~:E~3~ suggested that aqueous NOM in the dry-season had increasing aromaticity from upstream to downstream sites; while this quotient can also be indicative of molecular size (by an inverse relationship), the simultaneous decrease in DOC concentration indicates that molecular weight was not increasing downstream (Figure \@ref(fig:seasonalNOM)). SAC~254~ showed a similar increase in aromatic character from headwaters to mouth during the dry season, albeit the pattern was less pronounced and there was a larger difference between Chris crk and Leech-head in SAC~254~ than in E~2~:E~3~. 

\  

As we know from Chapter 3, DOC concentrations decreased from headwaters to mouth in both the wet and dry seasons, with the greatest dry-season variance at the head (Weeks) and mouth (Tunnel). The dry season patterns of decreasing DOC and SAC~254~ from low- to high-order streams were apparent in the wet season also. But the wet season spatial pattern of E~2~:E~3~ was almost the reverse of what was seen in the dry season. While dry season samples' E~2~:E~3~ showed increasing aromaticity from upstream to downstream, the wet season E~2~:E~3~ showed decreasing aromaticity from head to mouth. These seasonal differences suggest a possible shift in NOM source material, and/or a possible dilution effect.      

\

fig_cap = "\\label{fig:seasonalNOM} Sample results over the dry and wet seasons for [A] dissolved organic carbon concentrations (DOC), [B] specific absorbance coefficient at 254 nm (SAC~254~, m^-1^), and [C] the quotient of SAC~250~/SAC~365~ (E~2~:E~3~). Note that each season has a differnt y-scale to clarify patterns. The inset in panel B is an elargement of SAC~254~ for all sites except Weeks."

```

\  


##### Rising stage and NOM dynamics 

Antecedent moisture and/or sampling stage was important for each of the three predictant variables evaluated though RF VIM. Across the Leech WSA, the highest DOC occurred in the earliest events of each wet season (events 1 & 9, Table \@ref(tab:EventsTab)), while SAC~254~ peaked later than DOC during the third major event in the 2019/2020 wet season (event 11, Table \@ref(tab:EventsTab)). While E~2~:E~3~ indicated maximum aromaticity and molecular size occurred during the last major events, at the end of each wet season (events 3 & 17, Table \@ref(tab:EventsTab)).

\  

```{r EventsTab}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/CH4_events-n-samples.csv") %>% 
  select(-c("mean SUVA")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0,0,1,1,1,0,2,2,2), 
               caption = "Rain Events (Threshold of 50 mm and 14-hour Inter-event Period) Defined by Vertical Rack Sample Collection Across the Six monitoring Sites of the Leech WSA",
               col.names = c("Major event no.", "Start Date", "Duration (days)", "Rainfall (mm)", "Intensity (mm/24-hr)", "Samples collected", "mean DOC (mg/L)", "mean SAC~254~", "mean E~2~:E~3~"))

```

\  

Streams across the Leech WSA responded harmoniously to precipitation with synchronous changes in stage. Over the full sixteen-month study period, stage changes at the six sites were temporally synchronized and confirmed to be congruent with high confidence (p-value < 0.001, based on 1050 randomizations) via Kendall's coefficient of concordance (Kendall's W = 0.9721) and Spearman's ranked correlation (ρ = 0.9666). Rates of change in stream response were calculated for each site to evaluate the fastest and slowest times to peak stage and relative magnitudes of stage change (Table \@ref(tab:stageResponse)). As expected, rate of change in stage was greatest at the highest order stream, the Tunnel site, and smallest at Weeks crk.

\  

```{r stageResponse}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/Ch3_response_stage-summary.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0,1,1,1,1,2,1), 
               col.names = c("site", 
                             "shortest time to peak stage (hr)", 
                             "longest time to peak stage (hr)", 
                             "smallest change in stage (cm)", 
                             "largest change in stage (cm)", 
                             "minimum rate of stage change (cm/hr)", 
                             "maximum rate of stage change (cm/hr)"),
               caption = "Summary of Stream Response to Rain Events Across Six Monitoring sites in the Leech Water Supply Area.")
```

\  

To determine is a similar harmony was present for fluctuations in DOC or spectral properties, the proportion of common DOC and stage extrema samples were calculated (Table \@ref(tab:synchDOCstage)). A proportion of 1 indicates perfect agreement between samples of extreme DOC and sample stage, and zero indicates complete asynchrony between DOC and stage highs and lows. Most samples showed congruence between highs and lows of DOC with stage. West Leech was the only site which had a greater proportion of common maxima compared to minima, all other sites had more frequent occurrence of low DOC occurring at low stage that they did of high DOC occurring at high stage. 

\  

```{r synchDOCstage}
read_csv("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/tables/synchrony_DOC-stage_extrema-simultaneous.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = c(0,3,3),
               caption = "Proportion of Samples for Which Peak Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) was Collected at the Highest Sample Stage.")
```

\  

Each of the six site's samples showed majority, but not absolute, agreement in extremes of DOC-stage relationships. In general DOC concentrations were lowest at the beginning of events and increased with a rise in stage (Figure \@ref(fig:extremaplot)). 

\  

```{r extremaplot, out.width = "100%", fig.pos="h", fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:extremaplot} Stage and samples collected, highlighting samples with maximum and minimum DOC concentrations for each rain event and collection period. Black vertical lines indicate a subset of samples that were assessed more closely."

```

\  
\  

* Still to do:___look at individual events and pull out interesting facts (during this event, DOC concentration tripled or doubled, etc)... + differences among events___


Changes in DOC during events varied from a little more than 1% DOC change to nearly 100% change during event response (Table \@ref(tab:DOCResponse)). In general, DOC concentrations increased with increasing stage across the LWSA, thought the patterns were not linear and not consistent. The relationships between spectral indicators of NOM character and stage showed less variation than DOC with stage at all sites; again, the relationships were not linear (Figure \@ref(fig:stageRelations)). Weeks crk maintained the most consistent NOM aromaticity and molecular weight (E~2~:E~3~) with changing stage

\  

```{r DOCResponse}

\

#### Hysteresis of NOM with antecedent wetness 

Events 10 and 11 were relatively well represented by sampling and were found to be representative of other rain events as well. Wilcoxon tests showed events 10 and 11 were not statistically different from the other sampling events, with the same mean rain amounts (p = 0.732), durations (p = 0.837), and intensity (p = 0.549). 

(Figure \@ref(fig:events1011))

\  

```{r events1011, fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:events1011} Stage and sample collection points six Leech watershed monitoring sites during rain events 10 and 11 (fall 2019). Vertical yellow lines indicate the start of each rain event. Results of samples in each event were compared to antecedent 30-day rain to assess hysteretic behaviour."

knitr::include_graphics("R-outputs_UBC-forWater-MSc_HMc/figures/Ch4_sampling-events_10-11.png")
```

\  

Sample DOC concentrations from rain events 10 and 11 were plotted with their corresponding antecedent wetness (30-day rain) to explore possible hysteresis. The relationship of DOC concentration to antecedent wetness within a hydrologic event was interpreted in the same manner as a concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationship. Rapid flushing and dilution is indicated by a hysteresis loop with Clockwise rotation, and counter-clockwise rotation points to delayed material delivery and enrichment. Event 10 was the second measured rain event in the 2019/2020 wet season and had twice as much rain fall than event 11 (136 mm in event 10 compared to 68 mm in event 11, Table \@ref(tab:EventsTab)). Event 10 was longer in duration (6.4 days) compared to event 11 (2.3 days) with slightly lower intensity (21 vs 29 mm/24-hr). DOC concentrations were comparable between these two events (6.7 mg/L and 6.4 mg/L). 

\  

There was a clockwise rotation pattern for DOC with antecedent wetness in event 10 and a counter clockwise rotation in event 11 (Figure \@ref(fig:hysteresisplots)). 

```{r hysteresisplots, fig.cap = fig_cap}
fig_cap = "\\label{fig:hysteresisplots} Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations plotted with antecedent 30-day rain during events 10 and 11 at six monitoring sites in the Leech watershed."

```

\  

### Discussion

DOC concentrations were highest early in the wet season with peak concentrations found in the first event-based samples, while aromaticity of NOM peaked in later events. For smaller and less aromatic NOM, peak rain events were third in the wet season while larger more aromatic NOM peaked in the final events of the sampled wet seasons. These results indicate that early wet-season rain events export DOC-rich, aliphatic NOM from sources that are likely autochthonous and quickly depleted. Later wet-season rain events transport larger, more aromatic NOM from source pools that are likely allochthonous humic material whose export relies on greater landscape saturation and hydrologic connectivity. While DOC decreased across the wet season, the highest DOC sample was found at the highest sampled stage approximately 80% of the time.    

\  

For RF VIM assessment, predictor variables were separated based on whether they were static or dynamic with predictant variables because the combination of both types appeated to create bias in (not whether the input was numeric -- but rather whether the predictant changed (or not) with the predictor. 

\  

Indeed, Random Forest variable importance measure showed that weather conditions, especially antecedent wetness, ranked among the most important for predicting each of DOC, SAC~254~ and E~2~:E~3~. Antecedent wetness is an important watershed driver for NOM export as it influences the availability of source material and impacts hydrologic connectivity, or flow paths [@McMillan2018]. Aromaticity of NOM increased with antecedent wetness and sampling stage up to a threshold level for each (approximately 75% of maximum stage and about 150 mm of 30-day antecedent rain). The apparent thresholds of sampling stage and antecedent wetness as drivers for NOM character suggest a point at which humic NOM sources either reach maximum connectivity with the streams, or that the aromatic source pools are depleted.

\  

In general, DOC concentrations increased with increasing stage across the LWSA, thought the patterns were not necessarily linear and not always consistent. The relationships between spectral indicators of NOM character and stage showed tighter patterns than DOC concentration with stage at all sites, but again the relationships were not linear.

\  the magnitude and direction of water quality changes in response to precipitation, which provides information about solute supply and hydrologic connectivity [@Vidon2008; @Abbott2018; @Creed2015; @Zarnetske2018].

Increasing DOC on the rising limb indicates that source material is not limited and flux is driven by hydrologic connectivity; whereas source limited conditions likely drive NOM dynamics if DOC concentration decreases on the rising limb [@Zarnetske2018]. Analysis of rising limb Rack samples showed that DOC increased with increasing stage and peak DOC coincided with peak sampling stage approximately 80% of the time.  


\  

although sampling stage was directly related to rain conditions, in that more rain generated greater stream rise, rain was relatively more important as a predictor for DOC concentration than sampling stage was... this indicates that it may not have been the stage at which samples were collected, but rather at the antecedent wetness conditions (if you consider rain a proxy for wetness, which seems reasonable). 



\   

A pattern in DOC concentration during rising stage can provide information about NOM source and flux dynamics. Increasing DOC with rising stage suggests NOM transport dynamics were driven by hydrologic connectivity to an unlimited supply of source NOM. Alternatively, if DOC concentrations decrease with rising stage it's likely that the NOM source pool was limited (i.e. depletion of terrestrial allochthonous NOM supply)  [@Zarnetske2018].

\  

``` gooder here:```
Despite sub-basin DOC decreasing with increasing metamorphic representation, the absence of wark gneiss did not correspond to the site with highest DOC. This suggests that there is a more nuanced relationships between NOM concentrations and parent materials that couldn't be teased out in this RF analysis because of cross correlations between subsurface and other predictor variables. As the percent of wark gneiss was correlated to other parent materials, what is observed as an inverse relationship between DOC and amount of wark gneiss could indicate another relationship, potentially of increasing DOC with the decrease of some other parent materials. Based on values presented in Table \@ref(tab:WTScharacterSubbasinTable) it could be a relationship with the Leech River formation (argillite metagreywacke and metagreywacke) which was inversely correlated (-0.92) to   
 wark gneiss coverage. 
 
 \  

___Future directions:___

\  

With additional Fire-weather data, it would be interesting to explore whether the variables for fire risk (humidity) were also predictors for increased NOM or DOC.

\  

* matched sample filling-stage with continuous logger stage could be combined with rating curve to determine mass transport or loading... 

Combining methods of vertical sampling racks with standard synoptic grab sampling provided useful time-stamped discrete river samples data that could be adapted and correlated to local rating curves to calculate loads of river material (e.g. nutrients, metals, organics, etc.) exported from monitored catchments. Material transport loads are important for management decisions and comprehensive system understanding. 

\  

### Conclusions

* establishing connectivity among nested catchments as a baseline for experimental treatments (future)
